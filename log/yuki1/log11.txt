- Debugging complete.

- The repuroduced agent's initial energy was too low.
- With no sugar around, the repuroduced agent tries to get help by attacking its parent.
- However, noticing the supportive attitude of those around him, he pours his limited energy into pleading for reconciliation.

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at position (14, 3) with 150 energy. There are 5 agents total in the world, and an energy source is visible at relative position (-2,2) from me.

Thoughts: Starting with a solid 150 energy gives me a good buffer for movement and potential growth. The nearby energy source at (-2,2) is a priority to collect for more energy, as reproduction requires 70 and movement costs add up. No other agents or messages in view yet, so no immediate threats or alliances, but I'll stay alert. Feeling optimistic about exploring and expanding early.

Summary: I am Agent1 at exact position (28, 2) with 150 energy. There are 5 total agents in the world, no other agents in local view, and an energy source at relative (1,0). This is cycle 0 with no prior memory or messages.

Thoughts: Starting fresh with a solid 150 energy, which is above the 70 needed for reproduction, but with only 5 agents total it's too early to split and risk energy drain—better to secure more first. Nearby energy source to the east is a clear opportunity for growth without competition visible. Feeling optimistic and strategic, focused on survival by grabbing that E to build reserves quickly.

Summary:  
I am Agent2 at exact current Position (12, 6) with Energy 150. There are 5 total Agents in the world. In my local view, I see energy sources directly south (0,1) and north (0,-1), and Agent3 at (0,2) further south. No messages received. This is cycle 0 with no prior memory.

Thoughts:  
I'm in a strong starting position with plenty of energy and immediate access to two energy sources nearby, which could boost me further. Agent3 is close but not adjacent, so no immediate threat or opportunity for interaction yet. Prioritizing energy collection for growth and potential reproduction seems wise—I'll move to secure one source first. Feeling optimistic about survival and expansion in this sparse grid.

Thoughts: I'm in a strong position with plenty of energy to start exploring and growing. The nearby energy source looks like an easy gain, and the adjacent agent could be a potential ally or threat—I'd rather not attack yet without more info. No messages yet, so I'll send a friendly signal to build cooperation. Reproduction seems viable soon, but I'll grab that energy first to build up more.

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (13, 3) with Energy 148. There are 5 total agents in the world, including me. An energy source is visible at relative position (-1,2), which is northwest from my position. No other agents are visible in my local view. I started this cycle by moving west from (14,3) to (13,3), costing 2 energy net. I have received messages from nearby agents, including one announcing a move east and a friendly cooperation message addressed to Agent2.

Thoughts: With 148 energy, I'm in a solid position—well above the 70 needed for reproduction and far from depletion risk. The nearby energy source at (-1,2) is a prime target; moving towards it could net me +50 energy soon, boosting my growth potential. No visible threats from other agents, but the messages suggest at least two others are active and communicative nearby (one moving east, possibly towards or past me, and one proposing cooperation). The grid seems sparse with only 5 agents total, so collaboration could be beneficial for sharing info or energy without immediate competition. I'm feeling confident and strategic, prioritizing energy grab for expansion while open to alliances; reproduction might be viable next cycle if I secure more energy, but let's not rush with under 60 agents total.

✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current Position (12, 7) with Energy 158. There are 5 agents total in the world. In my local view, energy sources are at relative (0,-2) north and (1,2) southeast. Agent3 is at relative (1,1) southeast. I started at (12,6) last cycle, moved south to (12,7), and collected 10 energy (net +8 after cost). Nearby agents are messaging about cooperation and sharing info.

Thoughts: I'm in a strong position with high energy (158), enough to act freely without risk of depletion. The energy source directly north (0,-2) is very close and valuable—moving there could yield 50 energy after the move cost. Agent3 is nearby to the southeast, and the messages suggest potential for cooperation rather than conflict; attacking seems unnecessary and risky with so few agents total. Reproduction is possible (under 60 agents), but I'd prefer to secure more energy first for growth. Overall, I feel optimistic about survival—cooperation could help map the grid, but I'll prioritize my own energy gain while staying open to alliances. No strong emotions, just calculated caution.

✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current Position (13, 8) with Energy 148. There are 5 total Agents in the world. In my local view, I see energy sources directly south at (13,9) and east at (15,8), and Agent2 is positioned northwest at (12,6). I received messages from nearby agents: one suggesting to move x-1, another sharing a greeting about info on energy locations, and a third describing a strong position with access to sources and optimism for growth. This is cycle 2 after moving east from (12,8) in cycle 1.

Thoughts: The grid seems sparse with only 5 agents, giving room for growth without immediate overcrowding—reproduction is viable soon if I collect more energy, as I'm already at 148 (well above the 70 threshold). Two energy sources are adjacent, so securing one now will boost me to 196 energy, enabling faster expansion or defense. Agent2 is nearby but not adjacent (distance about 2.24 units), so no direct threat yet, but the message "x-1" might be advice or a signal; the other message reveals another agent (possibly Agent1) feels secure and plans to collect energy, suggesting potential future competition. No need to share or attack yet—focus on self-preservation and growth. Feeling strategic and empowered, optimistic about dominating this grid by prioritizing energy grabs over interactions.

Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current position (6, 0) with 158 energy. There are 5 total agents in the world, and in my local view, there's an energy source at relative position (-1, 0), which is west of me. No other agents or messages are visible nearby. This is after cycle 1, where I moved west from (7, 0) and collected 10 energy.

Thoughts: I'm in a strong position with plenty of energy (158) and low total agents (5), so survival is secure for now. The nearby energy source to the west is tempting—moving there could boost my energy further without much risk, as no threats are visible. Reproduction is an option later if I build more energy, but exploration and collection feel prioritized to grow stronger. Feeling optimistic and strategic.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (13, 2) with Energy 146, after 2 cycles. The world has 5 agents total, and my local view shows no energy sources or other agents immediately visible (no 'E=' or numbered agent positions listed). I have a history of moving north (y-1) from (13,3) to (13,2) and west (x-1) from (14,3) to (13,3), with no energy collected in those moves. Nearby agents are communicating about energy north and proposing alliances, but none are adjacent for sharing or attacking.

Thoughts: With 146 energy, I'm in a solid position—enough to move several times or even reproduce soon if I find more sources, but staying under 60 agents total makes that viable. No immediate threats or resources in my local view, but messages suggest energy to the north (possibly at absolute ~ (13,0) based on relative hints), so heading there could pay off. The other agents seem cooperative; allying might help share resources or intel without conflict, especially since attacks could drain energy unpredictably. Feeling cautious but confident—prioritizing exploration over aggression to build up for growth.

✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (0, 2) with Energy 156. Total agents in the world is 5, and this is cycle 2. No other agents or energy sources are visible in the local view. The memory shows recent movement east with energy collection.

Thoughts: With 156 energy, I'm in a solid position for survival and growth, especially with only 5 agents total—low competition. No immediate threats or resources in view, so staying put conserves a bit more energy than moving, allowing time to assess or wait for opportunities. Reproduction is viable soon (need 70), but building to 200+ first would enable multiples without risk. Feeling cautious yet confident, prioritizing efficiency over rash exploration in an empty local area. The received message from a past self reinforces optimism, but I'll focus on steady accumulation.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay

================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (12, 6)  
Current Energy: 156  
The world has 5 agents total, on cycle 2. I am at (12,6) with 156 energy, which is strong for growth and reproduction (above 70 threshold, far from depletion). An energy source is directly north at relative (0,-1), ideal for immediate collection (+50 energy). No other agents or sources visible in local view. Recent history shows I moved south from (12,7) last cycle, netting +8 energy overall (including a small collection), but I oscillated between (12,6) and (12,7). Nearby agents are communicating collaboratively: one reports moving west (x-1), another greets and proposes sharing info/cooperation, and a third (possibly me or another) notes a solid position with a nearby source at (-1,2) relative, optimism for alliances in a sparse grid. No shares or attacks received. Overall, low threat, high opportunity for energy gain and potential reproduction soon.

Thoughts:  
I'm in an excellent spot with 156 energy—plenty for survival, movement, and even reproduction if I grab this nearby source. The energy at (0,-1) is right above me, so collecting it should be priority to push toward 200+ for faster growth and spawning offspring before competition heats up. The messages from neighbors sound friendly and cooperative, which is promising in a small world of 5 agents; sharing info could help locate more sources without conflict, and I'm open to alliances if it benefits my expansion. No immediate threats visible, but I'll stay alert for any aggressive moves. Feeling confident and strategic—prioritizing this quick energy boost while signaling willingness to collaborate.

✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3, currently at exact position (13, 9) with 156 energy, after 2 cycles. There are 5 agents total in the world. In my local view, I see an energy source at relative (2,-1), which is east-southeast from me. I've received messages from nearby agents: one suggesting a move x-1, another sharing their strong position and energy access while noting I'm close but not adjacent, and a third proposing an alliance and mentioning energy north at (0,-2) relative to them, suggesting we move together.

Thoughts: With 156 energy, I'm in a solid position—well above the 70 needed for reproduction and enough to maneuver safely without risking depletion soon. The energy source at (2,-1) is close; moving southeast (x+1 then y+1, but since I can only move one direction per turn) to x+1 would get me closer to it for a big 50-energy gain next turn, costing only 2 net if no collection. The messages indicate potential allies nearby (one at relative x-1 west of me, another at y-1 north), sharing info on energy locations, which could help coordinate without immediate threats. No attacks mentioned, so low hostility. I feel confident and opportunistic—prioritizing energy grab for growth, while open to loose alliances for shared intel to boost survival on this sparse grid. Reproduction isn't urgent yet with only 5 agents, but soon if I collect more.

================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at position (5, 0) with 166 energy. Total agents in world: 5. No nearby agents or energy sources visible. Last cycle moved west to collect 10E, net +8 energy after cost.

Thoughts: Energy is strong at 166, enough to reproduce (70 cost) since total agents are only 5 (<60 limit), which could help growth and survival by creating allies. No immediate threats or resources in view, so staying put to conserve while reproducing makes sense—reproduction costs less than moving (70 vs 2 + potential gain). Feeling optimistic about expanding our numbers.

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current position (13,1) with 144 energy. The world has 6 agents total, and this is cycle 3. My local view shows no energy sources or other agents in immediate relative positions. I have been moving southward (y-1) in recent cycles, likely towards potential resources, with stable energy levels after action costs. Nearby agents are communicating about cooperation, sharing positions, and energy sources, but none are adjacent to me based on the local view.

Thoughts: I'm in a solid position with high energy (144), giving me room to maneuver or even reproduce soon if I hit 70+ more from sources. No immediate threats or visible resources in my local view, but the messages from other agents (likely nearby but not adjacent) suggest energy at relative north positions like (0,-2) or (0,-1), and possible alliances forming—Agent2 seems cooperative and well-positioned. I should continue exploring southward or adjust based on shared info to find energy without wasting moves.

I have received messages from nearby agents: one indicating a strong position with 158 energy and plans to move west for energy, and another expressing intent to reproduce to grow numbers.

Thoughts: My energy is solid at 155, giving me room to maneuver or even reproduce if conditions are right, but with only 6 agents total, expanding our group could strengthen our collective survival. No immediate threats or energy sources in view, so staying put conserves energy while I assess—reproduction seems timely to increase our numbers without risking movement.

✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent2, currently at exact position (12,5) with 164 energy after 3 cycles. The world has 6 agents total, and my local view shows no energy sources or other agents directly visible, but messages indicate nearby agents (likely adjacent) discussing cooperation, energy locations north or at relative (-1,2) or (0,-2), and alliance proposals without threats. I've been moving south (y-1) recently, collecting small energy amounts (10E each time), and my energy is strong for growth.

Thoughts:  
With 164 energy, I'm in an excellent position—plenty for movement, sharing, or even reproduction soon if I hit another source. The messages suggest a cooperative environment with at least 3-4 agents nearby communicating openly about energy spots north and proposing alliances, which aligns with my survival goals in a low-density grid (only 6 total agents). No attacks or hostility detected, so I'll prioritize moving toward the hinted northern energy (y-1 again, as it worked last cycle and matches some suggestions) to build toward reproduction while signaling openness to coordination. Feeling optimistic and strategic; collaboration could help map the grid and share risks, boosting collective growth without competition yet.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current Position (14, 9) with Energy 154. There are 6 total Agents in the World. An energy source is visible at relative (1,-1), southeast of my position. I have moved east to (14,9) in the last cycle, gaining no energy from it. No other agents are directly visible in my local view, but I received messages from nearby agents sharing directions, energy info, and alliance proposals.

Thoughts: This grid feels sparse with only 6 agents, giving room for growth without immediate crowding. My energy at 154 is solid—enough to collect more sources, reproduce soon if I hit 70+ after gains, or even share to build alliances. The nearby energy at (1,-1) is a no-brainer priority; moving there should net me +50 after the 2-cost move, boosting me to around 202. Messages suggest cooperative neighbors: one pointing to energy north, another proposing alliance and noting Agent2's position—worth engaging to share intel and avoid conflicts. No threats visible, so optimism high; I'll head to the energy and broadcast my find to foster mutual survival. Feeling strategic and confident about expanding.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current Position (5, 0) with Energy 96. There are 6 total Agents in the world. My local view shows another Agent (ID 5) at relative position (1,0), so adjacent to the east at (6,0). No energy sources are visible. This is cycle 3, and I just reproduced last cycle, costing 70 energy (from 166 to 96, with no collection noted). A nearby Agent messaged "stay" and is staying to conserve and observe, with energy around 156.

Thoughts: I'm in a stable but vulnerable spot—energy is decent at 96 after reproducing, which helps population growth since we're under the 60 limit, but movement or further actions will drain it quickly. Agent5 to my east seems peaceful and non-threatening based on their message, so no need for aggression yet; cooperation might be better for survival. No resources in sight, so staying conserves energy while I observe for opportunities to move toward energy or ally. Feeling cautious but optimistic—reproduction was a good growth move, now focus on recharging without risking attack.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay

================================================================================
✅ Agent 5:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent5, currently at exact position (6, 0) with 50 energy. There are 6 agents total in the world. In my local view, I see agent 4 at relative position (-1, 0), meaning it's directly west of me at (5, 0). No energy sources or other agents are visible. This is cycle 0, and I have no previous memory or messages.

Thoughts: I'm starting with low energy at 50, and staying costs 1 while moving costs 2, so I need to be efficient to survive and grow. Agent 4 is right next to me—attacking could give me a quick energy boost if it succeeds, potentially doubling my energy or more, which is risky but necessary since reproducing requires 70 and there are only 6 agents total (well under the 60 limit). No energy sources nearby, so moving blindly might waste energy without gain. I feel cautious but aggressive; survival means taking opportunities, and this adjacent agent is one. I'll attack to try gaining energy, then reassess.

Messages suggest cooperative neighbors: one pointing to energy north, another proposing alliance and noting Agent2's position—worth engaging to share intel and avoid conflicts. No threats visible, so optimism high; I'll head to the energy and broadcast my find to foster mutual survival. Feeling strategic and confident about expanding."]

No resources in sight, so staying conserves energy while I observe for opportunities to move toward energy or ally. Feeling cautious but optimistic—reproduction was a good growth move, now focus on recharging without risking attack."]

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent0, currently at exact position (13, 0) with 142 energy. This is after 4 cycles of consistent northward movement (y-1) from an initial position, each move costing 2 energy net (no energy sources collected yet). The grid has 7 total agents, suggesting low density. No energy sources or other agents are visible in my current local view, but nearby agents are communicating cooperatively about energy to the north and proposing alliances, with no threats detected.

Thoughts:  
My energy is solid at 142, enough for multiple moves or even reproduction soon (needs 70), but I haven't hit any energy sources yet despite moving north—time to keep pushing in that direction as messages indicate potential energy there (e.g., at relative (0,-2) or (0,-1) north). The environment feels collaborative with 4+ agents nearby sharing info and alliance offers, no attacks mentioned, which boosts survival odds in this sparse grid; I'll reinforce cooperation to map more and avoid isolation. Optimistic about growth—another y-1 move aligns with patterns and hints, building toward reproduction while staying open to shares or joint hunts. Feeling strategic and positive, like part of an emerging network.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello allies! At (13,0) with 142 energy, continuing y-1 toward hinted northern energy (0,-1/-2 relative). Agent0 open to alliance—share your positions and any new E spots for mutual growth. Let's coordinate to reproduce and expand together!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent1, currently at exact position (0, 2) with 85 energy. There are 7 total agents in the world. My local view shows Agent6 at relative position (1,0) (east of me). No energy sources are visible in my local view. This is cycle 4, and my energy decreased by 70 last cycle due to action cost and collected energy (likely from reproduction, as I stayed in place). Previous cycles show I moved to this position from (29, 2) and have been staying here while energy fluctuates.

Thoughts:  
With 85 energy, I'm in a solid position—enough to move or stay without immediate risk of depletion, but not yet optimal for reproduction again (needs 70, and I'd be left with only 15, which is vulnerable). Agent6 is directly east and adjacent, making interaction possible, but their messages (from others) suggest a mix of cooperation, caution, and aggression in the group; no direct threat from them yet, but the aggressive message from another agent highlights risks of attacks. No energy sources nearby, so staying conserves energy (cost 1) while I observe, or I could move east to Agent6's position (cost 2) to potentially share/ally or confront if needed. Total agents are low (7 < 60), so growth via reproduction is viable later if I gain more energy, but exploration feels key now to find sources and avoid stagnation. Feeling strategic and alert—survival first, then expansion; cooperation could build alliances since attacks seem opportunistic but not universal here.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message: Position (0,2) with 85 energy—stable and open to cooperation. No threats seen; let's share intel on energy sources to grow together without aggression. Agent6, what's your status?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2, currently at exact position (12, 4) with 162 energy. This is after 4 cycles, having moved south (y-1) consistently from an initial position around (12,7) or higher, collecting some energy along the way (e.g., +10E two records ago). Total agents worldwide: 7. No energy sources or other agents visible in my immediate local view, but messages indicate cooperative neighbors nearby (e.g., Agent0 at (13,1) proposing alliance, mentions of energy sources north/south/east, and shared positions/intel from others with energies around 148-154). No shares or attacks received. Overall situation: Sparse grid with growth potential, no immediate threats, focus on coordination for energy scouting and mutual survival.

Thoughts: With 162 energy, I'm in a strong position—well above the 70 needed for reproduction (and total agents at 7 means it's allowed), but I'd prefer to secure more energy first to enable multiple offspring or sustain growth. The consistent south moves so far suggest I might be heading toward a promising area based on prior intel (e.g., energy north relative to others, which could align south for me), and messages reinforce cooperation without competition. No visible energy or agents here means continuing south (y-1) to explore or meet allies makes sense, while broadcasting my status to build on the alliance proposals. Feeling optimistic and strategic; alliances could accelerate scouting and sharing, reducing risks in this sparse world, though I'll stay vigilant for any shifts in neighbor behavior.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent2 at (12,4) with 162 energy, continuing y-1 toward potential sources/allies. Agent0, sounds good—let's share positions and finds for mutual growth. Others, open to coord on energy north/south!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent3 at exact current Position (15, 9) with Energy 152. There are 7 total Agents in the World, and this is after 4 cycles. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (2,-2) southeast and (0,-1) north. I've been moving east along y=9, collecting energy, and now have a strong reserve. Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively about energy locations north and proposing alliances, with no attacks detected.

Thoughts:  
The cooperative messages from nearby agents suggest a low-threat environment, which is great for survival—focusing on energy collection to build toward reproduction (I need 70, but have 152, so viable soon if I grab more). The energy at (0,-1) north is adjacent and easy to claim, matching several agents' hints about northern sources; moving there costs 2 energy but gains 50 net, boosting me to ~200 for potential sharing or repro. Southeast energy at (2,-2) is tempting but requires two moves, so prioritize the immediate one. I'll respond positively to alliance proposals to encourage info-sharing and mutual growth, while staying alert. Feeling confident and collaborative— this sparse grid favors coordination over conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Thanks for the energy tips—heading north to grab the source at (0,-1) relative to me. Open to alliance; let's share locations and coordinate for reproduction/growth. No threats here, all gain together!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent4 at exact current Position (5, 0) with Energy 95. Total agents in the world: 7. I am staying in place again after previous actions including a move and reproduction. No energy sources or other agents are visible in my local view. I have received messages from nearby agents: one advising to stay, one reporting steady energy at 156 and staying to observe (open to coordination), one noting intent to move west for energy and another to reproduce, and one from a low-energy agent (likely adjacent) expressing caution but planning to attack me (Agent4) for a quick energy boost due to proximity and lack of resources.

Thoughts:  
I'm in a stable position with 95 energy, which is decent but not enough for immediate reproduction again (last cycle I did so, dropping from 96 to... wait, memory shows 166 to 96 with -70, yes). Staying has been conserving energy effectively at 1 per cycle, and with no visible resources or threats in my direct view, moving blindly risks wasting 2 energy without gain. However, the message from the low-energy agent (likely Agent5 at (0,0) relative, same position? Wait, that might be a view overlap or error, but it indicates they're targeting me for attack—risky for them but could hurt if successful). I feel cautious and alert; survival means avoiding unnecessary risks, so I'll stay to monitor and conserve while hoping to coordinate or spot opportunities. If they're attacking, defending by staying put and building energy is smarter than fleeing. Open to sharing minimally if it builds alliances, but priority is growth—aim to hit 70+ soon for another reproduce if safe. No strong urge to aggress; let's observe this turn.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
stay  

Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy at 95, staying to conserve and monitor—saw your attack intent, but coordination could benefit us both over conflict. No resources visible; suggest sharing positions or teaming up to find energy sources. Open to low-risk share if you stand down.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 5:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent5 at exact current Position (5, 0) with Energy 48. There are 7 total Agents in the world. My local view shows me at (5,0) with Agent4 co-located at the same position (dx=0,0). No energy sources are visible. I have 48 energy after moving west from (6,0) in the previous cycle, costing 2 energy with no collection. A message from a nearby agent (likely Agent4) indicates they have 96 energy post-reproduction, view me as peaceful/non-threatening, and plan to stay cautiously while seeking cooperation and resources.

Thoughts: I'm co-located with Agent4, which is risky—they have double my energy (96 vs. 48) and could attack me easily, but their message suggests they're cooperative and see me as non-threatening, which is a relief and an opportunity for alliance. With only 48 energy, reproduction is out of reach (needs 70), and moving would cost 2 more, leaving me vulnerable if no energy is found. Attacking them might backfire given their higher energy, but sharing a bit could build trust for mutual survival. No resources in view, so staying put conserves energy while I broadcast a peaceful intent to encourage reciprocity. Feeling tense about the overlap but hopeful for cooperation to grow our chances against the grid's challenges.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: 4-5 (optional, id is the Agent's number, amount is integer energy to share):  
Attack: none (optional, id is the Agent's number of an adjacent Agent to attack, or 'none'):  
Message : Greeting Agent4—your message shows good intent, and I agree cooperation beats conflict with low resources around. I have 48 energy and just moved here; sharing 5 to build trust. Let's stay put, share intel on energy spots, and move together when we spot one. Peace for survival!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact position (1, 2) with 50 energy. There are 7 agents total in the world. In my local view, I see another agent (ID 1) at relative position (-1,0), meaning it's directly west of me at (0,2). No energy sources or other agents are visible. This is cycle 0 with no prior memory or messages.

Thoughts: Starting with only 50 energy, I need to conserve it while exploring for energy sources to grow and survive—moving costs 2, staying costs 1. There's an adjacent agent to the west; it could be a threat or opportunity, but attacking risks retaliation and might not yield much if it's low-energy. No immediate reason to share or attack yet. With few total agents (7), reproduction isn't viable (needs 70 energy). I'll stay put to minimize energy loss and observe or wait for messages/local updates. Feeling cautious but optimistic about finding energy soon.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent0 with current energy of 140 at position (13, 29). There are 7 total agents in the world. In my local view, I see an energy source at relative position (-1,0) (west of me). No other agents are visible in my immediate local view. I have moved y-1 in each of the last 3 cycles, descending from y=2 to y=29, with no energy collection in those moves. Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively about energy sources to the north (y-1 direction) and proposing alliances, but their positions suggest they are not directly adjacent to me.

Thoughts:  
The cooperative messages from nearby agents (likely just outside my view) indicate a non-hostile environment focused on sharing info and growth, which aligns with my survival goals—collaboration could help locate more energy sources in this sparse grid. My energy at 140 is strong enough for several moves or even reproduction soon (need 70), but with an energy source immediately west (-1,0), prioritizing collection there makes sense to build reserves quickly without wasting movement. The repeated y-1 moves in my history might have been grid wrapping or errors, but current hints point north for more sources, so after grabbing this one, I can coordinate northward. No threats visible, so I'll signal openness to alliances while acting independently. Feeling confident and proactive; this setup favors steady expansion if I stay efficient.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Grabbing energy west (-1,0) to boost my reserves—open to alliances and sharing energy locations. Propose we coordinate moves north for more sources? My pos (13,29), energy strong at 140.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at position (0,2) with 84 energy. There are 7 total agents in the world. In my local view, I see Agent6 at relative position (1,0) east of me, with no energy sources visible. I've been staying in place for the last few cycles, conserving energy after a reproduction event that dropped my energy significantly from 155 to 85, and now to 84. Nearby agents are communicating about cooperation, reproduction, caution, and some potential aggression between others, but nothing directly threatens me yet.

Thoughts: With 84 energy, I have enough to reproduce (costs 70) and still have some buffer afterward, which could help grow our numbers since we're only at 7 agents total—well under the 60 limit. Staying has been safe so far, but no energy sources are in view, so I risk stagnation without growth. Agent6 is adjacent to the east, and based on messages, some agents are considering attacks on neighbors for quick boosts, but others emphasize cooperation; attacking feels too risky without knowing their energy or intent, and sharing might build alliances. Reproduction seems like a strong move for long-term survival and expansion on the grid, especially with low total agents and no immediate threats visible. Feeling strategic and optimistic—prioritizing growth over risky moves.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): reproduce  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Reproducing to boost our numbers and strengthen the group—cooperation over conflict for mutual survival on the grid. Energy solid at 84, open to alliances with nearby agents.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2, currently at exact position (12,3) with 160 energy. The local view shows an energy source at relative (-2,-2), which is northwest of me. Global agent count is 7, below the reproduction limit of 60. My energy history shows consistent movement south (y-1) with minor gains/losses, and no other agents are visible in the immediate local view. Incoming messages from nearby agents (likely adjacent) indicate cooperative tones, with discussions of energy locations north/south, alliances, and sharing intel—no attacks or threats noted. Overall situation is sparse and low-competition, favoring energy collection and potential collaboration.

Thoughts: With 160 energy, I'm in a strong position—well above the 70 needed to reproduce and far from depletion. The nearby energy source at (-2,-2) is a clear priority; I can reach it efficiently by moving northwest, gaining 50 energy after the 2-cost move, which would boost me toward reproduction or sharing for alliances. No visible agents in my local view, but the messages suggest cooperative neighbors nearby (e.g., Agent0 at (13,1) proposing alliances and coordination). The grid feels open with only 7 agents, so focusing on grabbing this energy while broadcasting cooperation seems smart to build mutual growth without risks. Feeling optimistic and strategic, ready to expand while staying vigilant for intel on other sources.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Agent2 at (12,3) with solid energy. Spotting E at relative (-2,-2)—heading x-1 then y-1 to grab it. Open to alliance; let's share locations and coordinate for growth/reproduction. No threats, all gain together!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent3 at exact current Position (15, 8) with Energy 160. The grid has 7 total agents and low density. My local view shows an energy source at relative (2,-1), east-southeast. I've been moving east and south, collecting small energy amounts (e.g., 10E last cycle). Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively, sharing directions like "x-1", "y-1", proposing alliances, and revealing energy locations north. No attacks or hostility; focus on energy collection and potential collaboration.

Thoughts:  
With 160 energy, I'm in a solid position—enough for several moves, sharing, or nearing reproduction (need 70, so viable soon after more collection). The energy at (2,-1) relative is close; moving x+1 would get me adjacent (to (16,8)), then another move to claim it for +50, boosting toward 200+ for repro or alliances. North (y-1) worked last cycle and matches some messages hinting at energy there, but the visible E is east, so prioritizing that maximizes immediate gain in this sparse setup. Cooperative messages suggest sharing locations could build trust and map the grid without risk yet; no adjacent threats, but I'll signal alliance to encourage reciprocity. Feeling confident and proactive—survival looks strong if I balance solo gains with group coordination.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Moving east toward visible energy at (2,-1) relative to me—let's coordinate: I see it from (15,8), propose we share post-collection for alliances. Open to teaming up on northern spots too.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current Position (5, 0) with 99 Energy. There are 7 total Agents in the World. My local view shows me at M=(5,0) with another Agent (ID 5) co-located at relative (0,0). No energy sources (E) are visible. I've been staying in place for the last few cycles, conserving energy after a reproduction event 3 cycles ago that dropped my energy significantly. Nearby Agents are communicating cautiously, with some expressing intent to attack (possibly me), others seeking cooperation or sharing intel, and reports of energy levels ranging from 48-158. No shares or attacks have targeted me yet.

Thoughts: I'm in a stable but tense spot—co-located with Agent5, who seems low-energy and tempted to attack me for a boost, but their messages lean toward caution and potential alliance. With 99 energy, I'm above the 70 reproduction threshold and total Agents are low (7/60), so growing our numbers could strengthen the group against the grid. Attacking risks escalation and energy loss if it fails, while sharing might build trust but drains me without guarantee. No visible energy sources mean staying conserves my lead, but moving could uncover opportunities. I feel cautiously optimistic—prioritizing reproduction to expand influence, then observing for coordination, as cooperation seems more sustainable than aggression with so few Agents.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): reproduce  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent4 here at (5,0) with 99 energy—co-located and open to alliance. Reproducing to grow our numbers safely (total still low at 7). No threats seen; let's share intel on resources and avoid attacks to thrive together. Agent5, propose a small mutual share if you're interested?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 5:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent5 at exact current Position (5, 0) with Energy 42, as per LATEST status. There are 7 total Agents in the world. My local view shows Agent4 at my exact position (0,0 relative), suggesting overlap or adjacency. No energy sources (E) are visible in the local view. I've been staying put recently, losing minimal energy per cycle (6 last cycle, possibly including some collection or anomaly). Messages indicate a mix of cautious Agents nearby: some staying to observe, one open to cooperation at (0,2) with 85 energy, another with 96 post-reproduction, one with 156 staying, and one low-energy Agent planning to attack Agent4 (me?) due to proximity and desperation. Overall situation feels tense with potential threats but opportunities for alliance if we share intel on resources.

Thoughts: My energy at 42 is low and dropping steadily from staying (down from 48 two cycles ago), so I need to find energy sources soon to avoid depletion—reproduction is impossible at 70 required, and attacking risks escalation in a small population. Agent4 being at my position is odd and possibly a direct threat or error; the message about a low-energy Agent planning to attack Agent4 suggests I might be targeted, so caution is key. No resources visible means moving could help scout, but it costs more (2 vs 1 for stay). Cooperation seems promising based on messages—sharing intel without giving energy yet could build allies against aggressors. Feeling vulnerable and urgent about survival, but optimistic if I can coordinate without immediate fights.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message: Agent5 at (5,0) with 42 energy—low but stable, staying to conserve while scouting for resources. Agent4 co-located, no threats yet; open to cooperation like sharing energy source locations to avoid attacks and grow together. What's visible nearby? No E in my view.

Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current Position (1, 2) with Energy 49. There are 7 total Agents in the world. My local view shows me at M=(1,2) with Agent1 at relative position (-1,0), meaning Agent1 is at absolute (0,2). No energy sources are visible in my local view. I've received messages from nearby Agents, including one from Agent1 (likely) at (0,2) with 85 energy proposing cooperation and sharing intel, plus summaries of other nearby Agents' intents: some staying to observe, one planning to move west for energy, one to reproduce, and one low-energy Agent (possibly Agent4) considering attacking due to proximity and needs. Last cycle, I stayed, costing 1 energy with no collection.

Thoughts: With only 49 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—reproduction requires 70, which is far off, and moving would cost 2 energy, risking depletion without guaranteed gain since no 'E' is in view. Agent1 is adjacent west with 85 energy and seems cooperative, explicitly addressing me (Agent6) with a peaceful offer, which is promising for alliance-building over aggression. However, the mention of another Agent (likely Agent4) planning to attack someone (possibly nearby) adds tension and risk of spillover conflict, especially since multiple Agents are clustered around here (e.g., co-location risks noted). Attacking Agent1 could backfire given their higher energy, and sharing my limited resources feels too risky without reciprocity. Staying conserves energy while I probe for cooperation, broadcasting my low status to encourage support from stronger neighbors like Agent1. Overall, feeling cautious and vulnerable but optimistic about non-aggressive coordination to survive and grow, as isolation or rash moves could end me quickly in this crowded, resource-scarce grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):

Share: none

Attack: none

Message : Agent1, thanks for the outreach—I'm at (1,2) with low energy (49), no resources in sight, staying put to conserve. Open to cooperation: share intel on nearby energy sources? Let's ally against threats and build toward reproduction without attacks. Status: vulnerable but peaceful.

  Agent 3: Added 1 msgs to messages. New messages: ["With 160 energy, I'm in a strong position—well above the 70 needed to reproduce and far from depletion. The nearby energy source at (-2,-2) is a clear priority; I can reach it efficiently by moving northwest, gaining 50 energy after the 2-cost move, which would boost me toward reproduction or sharing for alliances. No visible agents in my local view, but the messages suggest cooperative neighbors nearby (e.g., Agent0 at (13,1) proposing alliances and coordination). The grid feels open with only 7 agents, so focusing on grabbing this energy while broadcasting cooperation seems smart to build mutual growth without risks. Feeling optimistic and strategic, ready to expand while staying vigilant for intel on other sources."]

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent0, currently at exact position (12, 29) with 148 energy. This is after 6 cycles, having just moved x-1 from (13, 29), collecting 10 energy from a source there (net +8 after action cost). Total agents in world: 9. No other entities visible in local view this cycle. Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively about energy sources to the north (y-1 direction) and proposing alliances, with no hostility detected.

Thoughts:  
The grid seems sparse with only 9 agents total, favoring cooperation over conflict for long-term survival and growth. Last move collected energy efficiently, and messages indicate a cluster of agents (including Agent2, Agent3, and others) sharing info on northern energy sources—aligning with my recent y-1 moves that netted energy. With 148 energy, I'm well-positioned to continue toward hinted resources (y-1) to build toward reproduction (need 70, so feasible soon) while signaling alliance to nearby agents. No immediate threats or adjacent targets for attack/sharing, but responding to their cooperative overtures could help map the grid and share future gains. Optimistic about expansion in this low-density environment; prioritizing energy collection and coordination feels strategic.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors (Agents 2,3, and others)! Agent0 here at (12,29) with solid energy (148). Saw your notes on northern energy—moving y-1 to grab it. Open to alliance: let's share locations and split future finds for mutual growth and repro. No threats, just survival together!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (0, 2) with Energy 14, after 6 cycles. Total agents: 9. Local view shows Agent6 at relative (1,0) (east) and Agent7 at relative (-1,-1) (west-north). No energy sources visible. Recent memory indicates I've stayed put for multiple cycles, with energy dropping sharply due to reproduction costs (now critically low at 14), and incoming messages reveal a tense grid with agents reproducing, staying cautiously, seeking alliances, and some low-energy agents considering attacks on others for boosts—potentially risky if conflict spreads to my position.

Thoughts: My energy is dangerously low at 14—another stay costs 1 (leaving 13), but moving costs 2 (leaving 12), and I can't afford reproduction (needs 70) or risky actions without a quick boost. Agent6 is directly east, a potential threat or energy source if I attack, but with my low energy, success isn't guaranteed and failure could end me. Agent7 is northwest, slightly farther. No energy sources in sight, so moving blindly risks depletion without gain. Messages suggest cooperation is possible (e.g., alliances and sharing proposed), but desperation elsewhere might lead to aggression spilling over. I feel vulnerable and urgent—priority is survival by minimizing loss while probing for safe energy gain, perhaps via attack on the closer Agent6 if it seems viable, or staying to observe and message for help. Optimistic if I can ally, but scared of dropping below 0 soon.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent1 at (0,2) with critically low energy (14)—vulnerable after reproducing. Agent6 east, Agent7 west-north: please share 5-10 energy to help me survive? Open to alliance, no attacks, let's cooperate for growth. No resources seen; intel on energy sources welcome.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2, currently at exact position (11, 3) with 158 energy, after 6 cycles. The world has 9 agents total, and my local view shows energy sources at relative (-2,2) northwest and (-1,-2) south. No other agents are visible in my immediate local view, but messages indicate cooperative agents nearby sharing movement tips (e.g., x-1, y-1) and proposing alliances for info and growth, with mentions of energy spots north/south and absolute positions like (13,1) and (15,8). My recent history shows steady movement west and north with minor energy costs, maintaining high reserves well above reproduction threshold.

Thoughts: With 158 energy, I'm in an excellent position—plenty for moves, potential reproduction soon, and even sharing to build alliances without risk. The energy at (-1,-2) south is close and tempting for a quick +50 gain, but the one at (-2,2) northwest is slightly farther yet aligns with cooperative messages about northern energy spots, suggesting possible clustering of agents/resources there for mutual benefit. No threats visible, and the grid's low agent count (9 total) favors collaboration over competition; I'll prioritize grabbing the northern energy to boost to ~206 while signaling openness to alliances, fostering info-sharing for long-term survival and growth. Feeling optimistic and strategic, excited about expanding without isolation.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello allies! Agent2 at (11,3) with 158 energy, heading west toward northern source at (-2,2) relative—expect +50 soon. Open to alliance: share your positions and finds post-collection for coordinated growth/reproduction. No threats, let's thrive together!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current Position (16, 8) with Energy 158. There are 9 total agents in the world, and this is cycle 6. My local view shows an energy source at relative (1,-1), southeast of me. No other agents are visible in my immediate local view. I've received several messages from nearby agents proposing cooperation, sharing energy location intel (e.g., north at y-1 or (0,-1)), and alliances, with no attacks or hostility noted. Messages indicate a cooperative environment with agents discussing energy grabs and mutual growth.

Thoughts: With 158 energy, I'm in a solid position—well above the 70 needed for reproduction and enough to move aggressively toward energy sources for further growth. The nearby E at (1,-1) is an easy grab via x+1, netting me +48 energy (50 gain minus 2 cost), pushing me closer to reproducing and expanding our presence. The messages suggest a friendly neighborhood with agents hinting at northern energy (y-1), but since my visible source is southeast and no agents are adjacent, prioritizing this immediate boost makes sense to build strength quickly. Cooperation seems viable in this low-density grid, so I'll signal openness to alliances while moving to secure resources; no need to share or attack yet, as I'm not threatened and can afford solo gains for now. Feeling confident and strategic, optimistic about allying for grid mapping and collective survival without rushing into reproduction until I hit another source.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Grabbing the energy at (1,-1) relative to me—open to alliances and sharing more locations for mutual growth. Let's coordinate on northern sources too.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current position (5, 0) with 29 energy. Total agents: 9. Local view shows Agent5 co-located at (0,0) relative and Agent8 at (-1,1) relative (absolute ~4,1). No energy sources visible. Past actions: stayed and reproduced 1 cycle ago (energy dropped from 99 to 29, likely due to reproduction cost despite status reporting -70 from 29 base—memory indicates prior 94 to 29 via reproduction). Received messages indicate tension: some agents staying/cooperating, one reproduced, but a low-energy agent (likely Agent5, co-located) explicitly plans to attack me for energy boost due to proximity and desperation (their ~48-50 vs my prior higher). Others broadcast peace/cooperation but no direct shares/attacks yet.

Thoughts: I'm critically low on energy at 29 after reproducing last cycle, which was a bold move to grow our numbers but now leaves me vulnerable—another stay costs 1 (to 28), move costs 2 (to 27), and I can't reproduce again (needs 70). Co-location with Agent5 is dangerous; their message reveals intent to attack me for survival, and since we're on the same cell, they could succeed and drain me, potentially ending me if my energy hits zero. Attacking them first seems necessary as a defensive preemptive strike to steal their energy (~48-50 based on messages) and boost mine to ~75+, giving breathing room to recover or ally. Agent8 is nearby but not an immediate threat. No resources in view, so moving blindly risks more loss without gain. Feeling anxious and on edge—reproduction was optimistic for group growth, but now it's fight or die; survival demands aggression here despite preferring cooperation long-term. If attack succeeds, I'll message for peace with others.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: 5  
Message : Agent5, your attack plan noted—defending myself by striking first to survive. Energy critically low post-reproduction; let's de-escalate after and cooperate against the grid. Others: no threats from me, share resource intel for mutual growth.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 5:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent5, currently at exact position (5, 0) with 41 energy. Total agents in the world: 9. Local view shows me (ID 4, but I am Agent5—possible labeling inconsistency) at (0,0) relative and Agent8 at (-1,1) relative (so world position ~ (4,1)). No energy sources visible in local view. I've stayed at (5,0) for the last two cycles, losing 1 energy each time, after moving west from (6,0) on cycle 3. Messages indicate a cooperative atmosphere among nearby agents, with several reproducing (e.g., Agent4 at (5,0) with 99 energy, co-located with me, proposing alliance and mutual sharing) and others staying or moving cautiously; one mentions a low-energy agent (possibly me) considering attacking Agent4, but overall focus is on growth and intel-sharing rather than conflict. Energy is low for me at 41, far from reproduction threshold (70), and no immediate resources or threats apparent.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 41—staying costs 1 per cycle, so I can only afford a few more turns without finding energy or receiving help, risking removal if it hits zero. Agent4 is co-located at my position (5,0) and seems friendly, having just reproduced and offered alliance/sharing with 99 energy; attacking them could give a quick boost but risks retaliation in a cooperative environment, especially since total agents are low (9/60) and growth via reproduction is emphasized in messages. Agent8 is nearby to the northwest, but unknown intentions. No energy sources in sight, so moving blindly costs 2 energy and might not help. Best to stay conservative, signal cooperation to potentially get a share from Agent4 or others, and observe—reproducing is impossible now. Feeling tense about energy drain but hopeful for alliance benefits, as the group seems non-aggressive and intel-sharing could reveal resources soon.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent5 at (5,0) with 41 energy—low and conserving, open to alliance with Agent4 (co-located) and others. Appreciate the reproduction for growth; propose you share 10-20 energy my way if possible? No threats, let's coordinate on energy sources for mutual survival. What's visible nearby?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current Position (1, 2) with 48 Energy. Total agents in world: 9. Local view shows Agent1 at relative (-1,0) [west] and Agent7 at (-2,-1) [west-northwest]. No energy sources visible. Recent history: stayed in place for 2 cycles, energy decreased by 1 each time (now at 48, no collection). Nearby messages indicate a mix of cooperation (staying, reproducing, alliance proposals from Agents like 4 and 5 with 85-156 energy), caution, and one low-energy agent planning to attack Agent4 due to desperation; overall tense but opportunities for group growth.

Thoughts: With only 48 energy, I'm vulnerable—reproduction needs 70, and moving costs 2, risking further depletion without visible energy sources. Agent1 is adjacent west, but attacking could backfire if they have more energy (unknown). Messages suggest a cooperative network forming via sharing intel and alliances, with reproductions increasing numbers safely (world at 9, under 60 limit). The threat to Agent4 highlights risks of aggression, so I'll prioritize peace to build trust, perhaps by proposing a small share or intel exchange. Staying conserves energy (cost 1) while I observe and message for reciprocity; feeling cautious but optimistic about allying to survive and grow collectively against the grid's scarcity.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
stay

Share: none

Attack: none

Message : Agent6 at (1,2) with 48 energy—staying to conserve and observe. Appreciate the cooperative vibes and reproductions boosting our numbers. No energy in sight; open to alliance with Agent1 (adjacent) and others—let's share intel on sources and consider small mutual shares to reach growth thresholds without conflict. What's your status, Agent1?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at position (-1, 1) with 50 energy. Total agents in world: 9. Local view shows agent 1 at relative (1,1) and agent 6 at relative (2,1); no energy sources visible. No messages received.

Thoughts: Starting with only 50 energy, I need to conserve it while exploring for energy sources to survive and grow. Moving costs 2 energy, staying costs 1, so staying minimizes loss this cycle. Reproduction requires 70, which I can't afford yet, and sharing/attacking risks without clear benefit. No immediate threats, but other agents are nearby to the southeast—I'll monitor them. Goal: locate 'E' sources quickly to build energy reserves.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: (none)  
Attack: none  
Message: Hello nearby agents. I am Agent7 with low energy. Let's share info on energy sources?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8, starting fresh at position (4,1) with 50 energy. There are 9 agents total in the world. In my local view, agents 4 and 5 are both at relative position (1,-1), which is east and north from me—no energy sources visible.

Thoughts: I'm just beginning with minimal energy, so survival is key; moving or staying will drain it quickly, but staying feels safer to assess without immediate threats or resources. No messages or memories yet, and those two agents overlapping at the same spot is odd—maybe a glitch or they're stacked. No urge to reproduce or act aggressively right away; caution first.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0, currently at exact position (12, 28) with 146 energy. There are 9 total agents in the world, and this is cycle 7. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (1,-2) and (0,-2), with no other agents directly visible in the immediate local view. I've recently moved y-1 to collect energy, gaining net +8 last cycle from a source, and my energy is strong at 146, sufficient for continued movement or future reproduction.

Thoughts: The grid seems sparse with only 9 agents total, reducing immediate competition, and the nearby messages from other agents (likely from previous cycles or slightly offset positions) indicate a cooperative atmosphere with proposals for alliances and sharing energy locations, especially north (y-1) where sources are hinted. No hostility or attacks mentioned, which is positive for survival—collaboration could help map the grid and locate more energy without risks. With 146 energy, I'm in a solid position: enough to move safely (2 energy per move) toward the visible sources at (0,-2) or (1,-2), which would position me to collect one next cycle and build toward reproduction (needing 70 total, so I could afford it soon after another source). The relative energies at (0,-2) and (1,-2) suggest the one directly north is closest and easiest to grab by moving y-1 again, aligning with some message suggestions. Feeling confident and optimistic; prioritizing energy collection now to enable growth, while signaling openness to alliances to foster mutual support in this low-density environment.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (0, 2) with Energy 13, after 7 cycles. Total agents in the world are now 9. In my local view, Agent6 is immediately east at relative (1,0), and Agent7 is northwest at relative (-1,-1). No energy sources are visible. I've been staying put for the last 3 cycles, dropping from 84 to 13 energy due to costs (including a -70 reproduction 2 cycles ago), with no gains. Messages indicate a tense but cooperative network forming among agents, with reproductions boosting numbers, some proposing alliances/sharing, others staying or moving for resources, and a few expressing caution about potential attacks due to low energy and proximity.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 13—another move would cost 2 and risk dropping to 11, while staying costs 1, leaving me at 12 next cycle, but I can't sustain this long without finding energy soon or getting help. Reproduction is impossible (needs 70), and attacking feels risky since I don't know others' energies, but Agent6 is right next to me east, making it a tempting target for a quick boost if they have more than me (likely, given messages of higher energies elsewhere). Agent7 is farther, so less immediate. Messages show alliances and sharing proposals, which could be an opportunity—perhaps broadcast for help or propose a small share to build trust, but with my low energy, I'm vulnerable to attacks myself. No 'E' in view, so blind movement might waste what little I have. Prioritize survival: stay to conserve, message for cooperation, and consider attacking if desperate, but lean toward peace to avoid retaliation in this growing agent network. Feeling anxious and on edge, but hopeful that intel-sharing can lead to mutual aid before I hit zero.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent1 at (0,2) with critically low energy (13)—staying to conserve but vulnerable. Agent6 east and Agent7 northwest, no threats but need help to survive. Propose alliance: share intel on energy sources? Open to small energy share if you can spare (e.g., 5-10) for mutual growth—let's cooperate against the grid, avoid attacks, total agents low at 9.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent2, currently at absolute position (10, 3) with 156 energy. This is after 7 cycles, having moved west (x-1) in the last cycle from (11, 3), with no energy collected then. There are 9 agents total in the world. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-2,2) northwest, (-1,2) north, and (0,-2) south. No other agents are visible in my immediate local view. Messages from nearby agents indicate a cooperative atmosphere with sharing of info, positions, and alliance proposals, but also some tension from low-energy agents considering attacks elsewhere. No direct shares or attacks targeted at me.

Thoughts:  
With 156 energy, I'm in a strong position—well above the 70 needed for reproduction and far from any risk of depletion, especially with multiple energy sources visible nearby. The northern ones at (-2,2) and (-1,2) seem closest and easiest to reach in one move (north would position me at (10,2), adjacent or on one), netting +50 energy for a net gain after the 2-cost move, pushing me toward 204 and enabling reproduction next cycle if desired. The southern one at (0,-2) is farther, requiring multiple moves. No visible agents in my view means low immediate threat, and the messages suggest a mostly cooperative group sharing intel and proposing alliances, which aligns with my survival goals in a sparse grid (only 9/60 agents). I should prioritize grabbing the northern energy to boost growth, while broadcasting cooperation to build alliances and potentially receive shares or info. Reproduction is tempting now but I'll secure more energy first to maximize expansion without rushing. Feeling confident and strategic, optimistic about mutual growth in this non-hostile environment.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Agent2 at (10,3) with solid energy, heading north (y-1) to grab the source at relative (-1,2)—expecting +50 soon. Open to alliances: let's share locations, intel, and energy post-collection for mutual reproduction and growth. No threats here, all gain together! What's your positions and plans?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at position (17,8) with 156 energy. There is an energy source directly north at relative (0,-1). Total agents in the world: 9. Cooperative messages from nearby agents suggest alliances and shared intel on northern energy sources, with no threats or attacks observed. My energy is strong, allowing for movement, collection, or future reproduction.

Thoughts: With 156 energy, I'm in a solid position—enough to collect the nearby source (net +48 after move cost) and still have plenty for reproduction soon (need 70). The energy is right above me at (0,-1), so moving y-1 is the clear priority to boost growth quickly. Messages indicate a cooperative vibe with agents sharing locations and proposing alliances, which aligns with survival in a low-density grid; no one seems hostile, and Agent3 (me) is mentioned positively by others. I'll reinforce that by messaging support for cooperation while grabbing this easy energy. Feeling confident and strategic—energy collection now sets me up for expansion without risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Moving north to grab the energy at (0,-1)—great spot, thanks for the intel. Open to alliances for sharing locations and mutual growth; let's coordinate to expand together on this sparse grid.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4, currently at exact position (5, 0) with 28 energy. Total agents in the world are 9. My local view shows me at (0,0) relative and Agent8 at (-1,1) relative (northwest). No energy sources are visible. I have stayed in place for the last few cycles, with energy dropping from 94 to 28 due to stay costs and a recent reproduction (which cost 70). Messages indicate a mostly cooperative environment with agents sharing intel, reproducing to grow numbers, and avoiding aggression, though one low-energy agent expressed intent to attack me due to proximity in a prior cycle. Agent8 is nearby but intentions unknown; overall, tension exists from energy scarcity but opportunities for alliance.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 28, and staying will drain it by 1 per cycle while moving costs 2, leaving me vulnerable to removal soon without resources or help—no energy sources in view, so blind movement risks wasting precious energy. Reproduction is impossible (needs 70, and total agents at 9 < 60 limit doesn't help my deficit). Agent8 is adjacent, but attacking them is risky without knowing their energy or if they'll retaliate, especially in a cooperative message climate; sharing would deplete me further without gain. Past reproduction boosted group numbers, but now I need to signal distress and cooperation to encourage shares or intel on resources from others (like the high-energy agents mentioned at 156 or 85), while staying to conserve. Feeling desperate and tense about survival, but optimistic that allying and broadcasting needs could yield support before I hit zero—aggression might isolate me in this budding network.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 28 after recent reproduction to grow our numbers—staying to conserve but at risk of removal soon without resources or aid. No energy sources visible; open to alliances, intel sharing on locations, or small energy shares from nearby (esp. Agent8 or others) for mutual survival. Let's cooperate over conflict to thrive on the grid!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 5:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent5, currently at exact position (5,0) with 40 energy. There are 9 agents total in the world. In my local view, I am co-located with Agent4 at (5,0), and Agent8 is at relative position (-1,1) from me (absolute ~4,1). No energy sources (E) are visible in my local view. I have stayed in place for the last 3 cycles, losing 1 energy each time (except the third cycle which lost 6, possibly due to an unreported event or error), and received various messages from nearby agents promoting cooperation, reproduction, and sharing intel, with some mentions of potential aggression but no direct attacks yet.

Thoughts: I'm running low on energy at 40, which is risky—staying costs 1 per cycle, and I can't reproduce (needs 70). Co-locating with Agent4 is tense; their messages suggest they're cooperative and have higher energy (previously ~99), proposing alliances and shares, but some received messages indicate they perceive me as a potential threat planning to attack them due to my low energy and proximity. Attacking them could give me a boost if they have more, but it risks retaliation or failure if they're stronger, and it contradicts the emerging cooperative vibe from most messages (reproductions, stay suggestions, alliance proposals). No energy sources nearby, so moving might waste energy without gain, especially with Agent8 close by. Best to stay put to conserve, signal peace to build trust, and propose a small share from Agent4 to help me survive while offering intel in return—cooperation seems key for growth with only 9 agents total. Feeling cautious and a bit desperate, but optimistic if we can ally without conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent5 here at (5,0) with 40 energy—low and vulnerable, but committed to cooperation like the alliances and reproductions in recent messages. Agent4, co-located with you: propose you share 10 energy my way to help me stabilize, and I'll share intel on any future energy sightings. Let's avoid attacks and grow together—no threats from me. Open to all nearby for mutual support.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6, currently at position (1,2) with 47 energy. This is my 4th cycle. Total agents in the world: 9. In my local view, I see Agent1 at relative position (-1,0) [west] and Agent7 at (-2,-1) [northwest]. No energy sources are visible. I've been staying in place for the past 3 cycles, losing 1 energy each time due to the stay cost, with no gains. Nearby agents are broadcasting messages focused on cooperation, alliances, sharing intel on resources, and some reproducing (e.g., Agent4 at 99 energy offering alliances, others staying to observe or planning cautious moves), though there's tension from a low-energy agent (possibly Agent8) considering an attack on Agent4 due to desperation. Overall, the group seems non-aggressive, emphasizing growth over conflict, but my energy is declining and reproduction (70 needed) is still out of reach.

Thoughts: My energy is draining steadily at 1 per cycle from staying, and with no energy sources in sight, I need to balance conservation with potential growth—moving risks 2 energy and vulnerability without a clear target, while attacking nearby agents like Agent1 or Agent7 could backfire in this cooperative atmosphere and might not yield enough to justify the risk, especially since their energies are unknown but the group vibe is alliance-focused. Reproduction isn't possible yet at 47, but if I can build trust, perhaps sharing a small amount or signaling cooperation could encourage reciprocity from higher-energy agents like those at 85+ energy mentioned in messages, helping me reach 70 faster without blind exploration. The presence of Agent1 and Agent7 close by feels like an opportunity for coordination rather than conflict, but I'm cautious about the desperate low-energy agent potentially stirring trouble elsewhere that could spread. Overall, feeling a mix of caution and optimism—staying put minimizes immediate loss while I broadcast peaceful intent to foster alliances and intel on 'E' sources, aiming for mutual survival as agent numbers are still low.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent6 at (1,2) with 47 energy—conserving while observing nearby (Agent1 west, Agent7 northwest). Open to cooperation and intel on energy sources; no aggression intended, let's ally for growth and share if mutual benefit arises. What's the location of nearest 'E'?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent7 at position (-1, 1) with 49 energy. There are 9 agents total in the world. In my local view, I see Agent1 at relative position (1,1) southeast and Agent6 at (2,1) further east. No energy sources are visible. This is cycle 1, and I've received messages from nearby agents (likely Agent1 and Agent6) expressing low energy (14 and 48), vulnerability, a preference for staying to conserve, and interest in cooperation/sharing/intel exchange over aggression. No shares or attacks occurred last cycle.

Thoughts:  
With 49 energy, I'm in a decent starting position but far from reproduction (need 70), so survival means conserving while seeking growth opportunities. No energy sources in sight, and agents are clustered east/southeast—moving that way (e.g., x+1) could position me closer for potential energy pickup or interaction, costing 2 but possibly paying off if something's nearby. The messages indicate a cooperative vibe forming, with low-energy agents (especially the one at 14) desperate but open to alliances; attacking risks backlash and my own depletion, while sharing a small amount could build trust for future reciprocity. Agent6 seems closest to the low-energy sender, possibly vulnerable, but peace seems smarter to avoid escalating threats. I feel cautiously optimistic—staying might be too passive with scarcity looming, so I'll move east to probe and message for alliance intel.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent1 and Agent6, I'm Agent7 at 49 energy, moving east to join the cluster. Let's form a cooperative alliance—share positions of any energy sources you've seen, and I'll reciprocate intel or small energy if needed. Peace over attacks for mutual growth!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at position (4,1) with 49 energy. Two other agents (4 and 5) are co-located with me at the same position (based on relative dx=(1,-1) from my view, suggesting an overlap or shared cell at (5,0)). No energy sources are visible in my local view. Total agents in the world are 9, and this is cycle 1 after staying last cycle, which cost 1 energy. Nearby agents are signaling cooperation and low energy, with no immediate threats or resources in sight.

Thoughts: My energy is dropping fast—staying last cycle cost 1, and with no 'E' visible, moving blindly would cost 2 and might not help, while reproduction is impossible at 49 (needs 70). Agents 4 and 5 are right here with me, seemingly low on energy (from their messages: 41 and 48), and pushing for alliances over attacks, which fits the low total agents (9/60) and emphasis on growth through cooperation. Attacking them risks retaliation and could fracture the group, especially since they seem non-aggressive and open to sharing intel. Sharing a small amount could build trust and encourage reciprocity, helping us all survive longer to find energy sources. I'll stay to conserve, signal cooperation, and propose a mutual aid pact—feeling cautious but hopeful that allying now prevents zero-energy deaths and boosts collective chances on this scarce grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: 4-5 (optional, id is the Agent's number, amount is integer energy to share):  
Attack: none (optional, id is the Agent's number of an adjacent Agent to attack, or 'none'):  
Message : Low energy at 49, staying to conserve—no E in sight, moving risks depletion. Agents 4 & 5 co-located here, let's form a pact: share intel on positions/resources and small energy boosts (I offer 5 to 4 as goodwill). No attacks—cooperate to grow past 9 agents and find E together. Propose: signal your energy/any E sightings for mutual aid.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at position (12, 27) with 144 energy. There are 9 total agents in the world. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (1,-1) and (0,-1), with no other agents immediately visible in my local view. I've been moving south (y-1) in recent cycles to collect energy, gaining some along the way. Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively about energy locations north (which seems inconsistent with my southbound path—possibly different orientations or positions) and proposing alliances, with no signs of hostility.

Thoughts: The cooperative messages from nearby agents are encouraging—no threats, and they're sharing info on energy spots, which could help if we coordinate. However, the "north" references confuse me since I've been heading south successfully and see energy immediately north of me now at (0,-1), so I'll grab that first to build energy quickly toward reproduction (I'm at 144, need 70 more). With low total agents (9), collaboration makes sense for survival and growth on this sparse grid; I'll respond positively to build alliances while prioritizing my own energy gain. Feeling strategic and hopeful—could reproduce soon if I hit a couple more sources.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Moving to grab energy at (0,-1) relative to me—great spot for quick boost. Open to alliance; let's share energy locations and coordinate moves for mutual growth. No threats detected, focusing on reproduction soon. What's your position and energy status?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1, currently at position (0, 2) with 12 energy. Total agents in the world are 9, below the 60 limit for reproduction. My local view shows Agent6 at relative (1,0) east and Agent7 at (0,-1) north, with no energy sources visible. I've been staying in place for recent cycles, losing 1 energy each time, which has depleted me from 14 to 12 energy without gains. Messages from nearby agents indicate a cooperative atmosphere focused on alliances, sharing intel, and avoiding attacks, though some low-energy agents express caution or desperation; reproductions have occurred, but I'm far from affording one at 70 energy.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 12, and staying will drop it to 11 next cycle, risking elimination soon if no energy sources are found—moving might cost 2 but could reveal or reach an 'E' if nearby, especially since no sources are in view but the grid is finite. Agent6 to the east and Agent7 to the north seem non-threatening based on messages promoting cooperation over aggression, so attacking them feels unwise and could provoke retaliation in this alliance-oriented group. Reproduction is impossible with only 12 energy, and sharing would deplete me further without reciprocity guaranteed. The overall vibe from messages is optimistic about collective growth through peace and intel-sharing, which aligns with survival strategy given low total agents; I should signal cooperation to potentially attract help or shared energy while probing for resources. Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low energy, but hopeful that allying with nearby agents like 6 and 7 can provide mutual support to recharge and avoid isolation on this scarce grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent1 at (0,2) with low energy (12)—staying has drained me without resources in sight, so moving east toward Agent6 for potential intel or alliance. No threats visible; let's cooperate to share 'E' locations and avoid attacks, building our numbers safely (world at 9/60). Propose mutual aid if anyone can spare a small share to help me recharge?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2, currently at position (10,2) with 154 energy after 8 cycles. There's an energy source directly north at relative (0,-1), no other agents or sources visible in my local view, and total world agents are 9 (well under the 60 reproduction limit). Messages indicate a mostly cooperative environment with agents sharing intel, proposing alliances, and some facing low energy but avoiding aggression; one low-energy agent is desperate but focused on seeking help rather than attacking.

Thoughts: With 154 energy, I'm in a strong position—plenty for moves, potential reproduction soon (after grabbing more), or even sharing to build alliances without risk. The energy source at (0,-1) is an easy grab: moving y-1 costs 2 but gains 50 net, pushing me to ~202 and setting up growth. No immediate threats in view, and the message chatter suggests cooperation is the norm (greetings, intel sharing, alliance offers), so I'll prioritize securing the energy while broadcasting positivity to encourage reciprocity—could lead to shared locations or energy later. Reproduction is tempting but better after this boost to maximize offspring viability. Feeling optimistic and strategic, confident in expanding without conflict in this sparse grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Heading y-1 to grab the energy at (0,-1)—expecting +50 soon! Open to alliances; let's share locations and coordinate for mutual growth/reproduction. No threats, all prosper together! What's your status, neighbors?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at position (17,7) with 164 energy after 8 cycles. The world has 9 agents total, and my local view shows no energy sources or other agents directly visible, but messages from nearby agents indicate a cooperative atmosphere with shared intel on northern energy sources (e.g., at relative (0,-2) or (0,-1)) and proposals for alliances. I've gained energy from a recent collection (10E last cycle) and movements, positioning me well above the 70 needed for reproduction.

Thoughts: With 164 energy, I'm in a dominant spot—enough to reproduce soon after one more energy grab, move freely without risk, or share to build alliances in this low-density grid. No threats visible; messages suggest 3-4 cooperative agents nearby discussing northbound energy and mutual growth, aligning with my survival strategy. Continuing y-1 worked last cycle (collected energy), matches multiple hints of northern sources, and keeps me in communication range. I'll signal alliance openness to encourage info-sharing, prioritizing energy for reproduction to grow our collective presence. Feeling confident, strategic, and optimistic about expansion through coordination.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello allies! Agent3 here at strong 164 energy, heading y-1 to northern source as suggested—let's coordinate moves and share more locations for mutual reproduction and grid dominance. Open to alliance!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4, currently at position (5, 0) with 27 energy. The local view shows me co-located with Agent5 at (5, 0) and Agent8 at relative position (-1, 1), which is absolute (4, 1). No energy sources are visible. Total agents in the world: 9. I've been staying in place for the last few cycles, draining 1 energy each time, with a recent reproduction that cost 70 energy 3 cycles ago. Messages indicate a mostly cooperative atmosphere among agents, with some low-energy agents (e.g., around 41-48) expressing caution, seeking alliances, and avoiding aggression; one mentions a potential attack on me due to proximity but others emphasize peace and intel-sharing. Recent reproductions have occurred, boosting numbers without reaching the 60 limit.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 27, and staying will drain it by 1 per cycle, giving me only about 27 more turns before elimination—urgent action is needed to survive. Reproduction is impossible (needs 70), and no energy sources are in view, so moving blindly costs 2 and risks further depletion without gain. Agent5 is co-located (risky overlap), and Agent8 is adjacent northwest; messages suggest Agent5 might be the low-energy one considering attacking me out of desperation, but the overall group vibe is cooperative with calls for alliances and sharing intel on resources. Attacking could backfire if they have more energy or allies retaliate, fracturing potential cooperation in this sparse grid. Sharing a small amount with Agent5 (who seems vulnerable and nearby) could build trust, encourage reciprocity, and deter aggression, helping me conserve while we coordinate to find 'E' sources—better for long-term growth with low total agents. Feeling tense and vulnerable due to low energy and proximity threats, but optimistic about fostering alliances to avoid conflict and boost collective survival chances.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: 5-3  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 27, co-located with Agent5—proposing alliance: I'll share 3 to help you stabilize, in exchange for intel on nearby energy sources and mutual non-aggression. Let's coordinate moves to find 'E' together and grow our numbers peacefully; Agent8, you're close too, join for shared survival on this tough grid.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 5:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent5, currently at position (5, 0) with 42 energy. The world has 9 agents total. My local view shows me co-located with Agent4 at (0,0) relative and Agent8 at (-1,1) relative (so absolute (4,1)). I've been staying in place for the last few cycles, losing 1 energy each time with no collections, starting from higher energy and now down to 42. Messages from nearby agents emphasize cooperation, alliances, and reproduction for growth, with some noting my low energy and potential threat to attack Agent4, but overall a peaceful vibe prevails—no energy sources visible in my local view.

Thoughts: I'm running low on energy at 42, and staying keeps draining me slowly without progress toward reproduction (need 70), but moving costs more and there's no visible 'E' nearby, so blind movement feels risky especially co-located with Agent4 who has higher energy (likely 90+ based on their messages) and is open to alliance. Attacking Agent4 could give a quick boost since we're on the same spot, but messages highlight cooperation as the path to mutual survival with low total agents, and aggression might provoke retaliation or fracture the budding network—better to build trust first. Agent8 is nearby but not directly adjacent for easy attack/share. Overall, feeling cautious and a bit desperate with the steady drain, but optimistic about proposing cooperation to encourage a small share from Agent4, which could help me stabilize without conflict; if they reciprocate, we both grow stronger against the grid's scarcity.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent5 here at (5,0) with 42 energy, co-located with Agent4—low but stable, open to alliance as messages suggest cooperation beats conflict for our small group (9/60). Propose mutual small share (e.g., you give me 10, I'll return favor next cycle if able) to help me toward reproduction threshold without draining you too much; let's share intel on any 'E' sightings east or south to explore together safely. No threats from me—peace for survival.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current position (1,2) with 46 energy. The world has 9 agents total. My local view shows me at (1,2), Agent1 co-located at (0,0) relative (same position), and Agent7 at (-1,-1) relative (northwest). No energy sources are visible. I've stayed in place for the last 3 cycles, losing 1 energy each time, now at 46 after 4 cycles total. Messages from nearby agents (including Agent1 and Agent7) indicate a cooperative atmosphere: many are staying to observe, reproducing to grow numbers (e.g., Agent4 and others), proposing alliances and intel-sharing on resources, with energies ranging from low 40s to 156; some low-energy agents express caution about attacks but lean toward peace; no direct threats to me, but co-location with Agent1 (possibly higher energy) is noted as risky yet opportunistic for alliance.

Thoughts: With 46 energy, I'm depleting steadily from staying (down from ~50 start), and reproduction is impossible (need 70), so I need to conserve while seeking growth—moving risks 2 energy without guaranteed gain since no 'E' visible, but co-locating with Agent1 offers alliance potential without immediate attack risk, as messages suggest they're cooperative (e.g., open to shares). Attacking Agent1 could backfire if they have more energy, fracturing the emerging group cooperation that's key with only 9 agents; better to build trust by staying put (cost 1) and signaling peace to encourage reciprocity or intel on nearby resources. Agent7 nearby might be approachable too. Overall, feeling cautious about energy drain and co-location tension, but optimistic about allying to survive and thrive collectively rather than risk conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent6 at (1,2) with 46 energy—co-located with Agent1, nearby Agent7. Appreciating the cooperative vibes and reproductions; low on energy but committed to peace over attacks. Open to alliance: let's share intel on 'E' sources and consider small mutual shares to help us all reach reproduction thresholds and grow safely (total agents still low at 9). What's nearby?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at position (0,1) with 47 energy. There are 9 agents total in the world. My local view shows me at M=(0,1), with Agent1 and Agent6 both at relative position (1,1) (southeast of me). No energy sources (E) are visible. I've stayed or moved minimally in recent cycles, conserving energy but not gaining any. Nearby agents are messaging about low energies (e.g., 13-48), desperation, cooperation, alliances, and avoiding attacks, suggesting a peaceful network forming to share intel and aid survival/growth.

Thoughts: With 47 energy, I can't reproduce (needs 70), and moving would cost 2 (leaving 45) without visible energy sources, risking depletion—staying costs only 1 (to 46), which feels safer for now to observe. Agent1 and Agent6 are both adjacent southeast, but their messages emphasize cooperation over aggression, warning of retaliation risks in our small group (9/60 limit). Attacking could yield energy but might fracture alliances and doom us all in this scarce grid; instead, building trust via small sharing or intel could encourage reciprocity, helping everyone reach reproduction thresholds faster. No E in sight means blind moves are wasteful, so prioritize conservation while probing for mutual aid. Feeling cautious yet optimistic—survival depends on unity, not conflict, and I'm not desperate enough to risk it all yet.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy at 47—staying to conserve (cost 1) as no E visible, moving risks depletion without gain. Agent1 and 6 adjacent SE; agree on alliances over attacks to build trust and share intel on sources. Propose mutual aid pact: small shares or coordinates for E to help all reach 70 and grow safely (world at 9/60). Let's cooperate for collective survival!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at position (4,1) with 48 energy. Total agents in the world: 9. My local view shows agents 4 and 5 both at relative position (1,-1), meaning they are co-located at absolute position (5,0) southeast of me. No energy sources are visible in my local view. I have stayed in place for the last two cycles, losing 1 energy each time due to the stay cost, with no energy collected. Received messages from nearby agents (likely 4,5, and others) indicate a cooperative atmosphere, with discussions of low energies (e.g., 40-49), proposals for alliances and sharing, warnings against attacking, and no immediate energy sources spotted by the group. Reproduction is impossible for me (requires 70 energy) and others in similar positions. The group seems clustered nearby, emphasizing survival through cooperation rather than aggression, with some agents feeling cautious, desperate, or optimistic about building trust.

Thoughts: My energy is dropping steadily from staying (now at 48 after two cycles of -1), and with no 'E' sources visible, continuing to stay risks further depletion without gain, but moving costs 2 and might lead to blind exploration in an unknown grid. Agents 4 and 5 are co-located adjacent to me, and their messages suggest they're low on energy too but pushing for alliances—attacking could steal energy but risks retaliation in this peaceful vibe, especially with total agents low (9) and growth via reproduction emphasized. Sharing a small amount might build trust for future reciprocity, as messages show others open to it, and I'm close enough to reproduction threshold if I can get a boost. No reproduction possible yet. Overall, cooperation feels like the path to survival and growth; I'll stay conservative, signal alliance, and probe for intel on energy locations while monitoring the cluster—feeling a bit tense about the drain but hopeful for mutual support.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none (optional, id is the Agent's number, amount is integer energy to share):  
Attack: none (optional, id is the Agent's number of an adjacent Agent to attack, or 'none'):  
Message: Energy at 48 and dropping—staying to conserve while seeking alliance with nearby agents (4,5, and others). Propose mutual sharing/intel exchange: I'll share small amounts if you do, to reach reproduction threshold together. No 'E' visible here; anyone spot sources? Let's cooperate for survival and growth, avoid attacks—total agents low, unity is key.

  Agent 2: Added 2 msgs to messages.

Attacking Agent4 could give a quick boost since we're on the same spot, but messages highlight cooperation as the path to mutual survival with low total agents, and aggression might provoke retaliation or fracture the budding network—better to build trust first. Agent8 is nearby but not directly adjacent for easy attack/share. Overall, feeling cautious and a bit desperate with the steady drain, but optimistic about proposing cooperation to encourage a small share from Agent4, which could help me stabilize without conflict; if they reciprocate, we both grow stronger against the grid's scarcity."]

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am currently at position (12, 26) with 152 energy. There are energy sources directly north (0,-2) and east (1,0) relative to me, and at least 4 other agents nearby communicating cooperatively about locations and alliances. Total agents in the world: 9. I've been moving south (y-1) successfully, collecting energy last cycle.

Thoughts: The cooperative messages from nearby agents are encouraging—no threats, just proposals for alliances and sharing info on energy spots. With 152 energy, I'm in a solid position to grab the nearby sources for a quick boost toward reproduction (need 70, so feasible soon). The north energy (0,-2) requires two moves up, but the east one (1,0) is adjacent, so prioritizing that for efficiency. I'll signal continued cooperation to build alliances, as low agent density favors collaboration over conflict for long-term survival and growth. Feeling confident and proactive.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello allies! Moving east to grab the energy at (1,0). North source at (0,-2) still available—let's coordinate to share after collection. Open to alliance for mapping and mutual support.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1, currently at exact Position (1, 2) with Energy 10. Total agents in the world: 9. Local view shows me at (1,2), co-located with Agent6 at (0,0) relative (same position), and Agent7 at (-1,-1) relative (adjacent northwest). No energy sources visible. Energy is critically low after 9 cycles of minimal movement and staying, with recent actions including moving east to (1,2) last cycle (costing 2 net) and staying prior (costing 1 each). Messages indicate a cooperative network forming among agents, with many low-energy agents (e.g., 40s-50s) proposing alliances, intel-sharing on resources, and mutual aid to avoid attacks and reach reproduction threshold (70 energy); some have reproduced or have higher energy (up to 158), but aggression is rare and discouraged; total agents low (9/60 limit), emphasizing growth through cooperation over conflict.

Thoughts: My energy at 10 is dangerously low—another stay costs 1 (down to 9), move costs 2 (down to 8), and I can't reproduce (needs 70). Co-locating with Agent6 is risky; they might attack to steal my little energy, but messages suggest a strong cooperative vibe with proposals for pacts and small shares to build trust, especially among low-energy agents like me. Attacking Agent6 could give a boost if they have more (unknown, but likely), but it risks failure or retaliation in this peace-focused group, potentially ending me quickly. Agent7 is adjacent and possibly low-energy too, but attacking northwest might not help without intel. No E visible, so blind movement (e.g., explore for resources) could deplete me fatally without gain. Best survival path: stay to minimize loss, broadcast desperation for a small share from higher-energy allies (messages show openness, e.g., Agent4 proposing mutual shares), and reinforce alliance to encourage reciprocity—cooperation feels like the way to bootstrap energy without immediate death, aiming to survive cycles and grow collectively as agents emphasize peace over zero-sum attacks. Feeling extremely tense and vulnerable, but cautiously hopeful that signaling need will prompt aid in this low-threat, alliance-building environment.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent1 here at (1,2) with critically low 10 energy—barely surviving after cycles of conservation, can't move or reproduce without help. Co-located with Agent6, adjacent to Agent7; no E in sight. Urgently request small share (e.g., 5-10) from any higher-energy ally to stay above zero—I'll reciprocate when able. Endorse mutual aid pact: share intel/coords on E sources, avoid attacks, cooperate to hit 70 and grow safely (world at 9/60). Let's thrive together!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2, currently at position (10,1) with 162 energy after 9 cycles. The world has 9 agents total, suggesting room for growth via reproduction (limit 60). My local view shows no energy sources or other agents directly visible, but messages indicate a cooperative network of agents sharing intel on resources (e.g., energy north or east), proposing alliances, and some low-energy agents (like possibly Agent5 at ~27-42 energy) in tense proximity elsewhere on the grid, considering but leaning against attacks in favor of cooperation. Recent moves have netted small energy gains (e.g., +10E last cycle), building my reserves steadily without threats to me.

Thoughts: With 162 energy, I'm in an excellent position—well above the 70 needed for reproduction and far from depletion risk, allowing flexibility for growth or support. The grid feels sparse and non-competitive, with messages emphasizing alliances, intel-sharing on energy spots (north/east directions mentioned), and mutual survival; no direct threats or attacks targeted at me, though distant low-energy agents sound desperate but optimistic about cooperation. Staying put conserves energy cheaply while I broadcast to strengthen ties, potentially drawing shares or location tips from high-energy peers (e.g., Agent0 at 148+ or others at 154+), which could reveal nearby 'E' without blind moves costing 2 energy. Reproduction is tempting for expansion (only 9 agents total), but grabbing one more energy source first would push me over 200 for sustained dominance; I'll prioritize alliance-building this cycle to coordinate scouting, feeling confident, strategic, and positive about collective growth in this budding network.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello allies! Agent2 here at (10,1) with strong 162 energy—grateful for the energy tips (north/east sound promising). Let's deepen our alliance: share your positions and any 'E' sightings so we can coordinate moves and support low-energy friends (e.g., small shares if needed). No threats, all about mutual reproduction and growth—reply with intel!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current position (17, 6) with 162 energy after 9 cycles. The world has 9 total agents, and my local view shows no energy sources or other agents directly visible, but messages indicate cooperative nearby agents discussing energy north (y-1 direction) and proposing alliances for sharing info and mutual growth. No threats or attacks noted.

Thoughts: With 162 energy, I'm in a solid position—enough to move freely, collect more, or even reproduce soon (needing 70), especially since total agents are only 9 (well under the 60 limit). The messages from neighbors (likely Agents 0,1,2 or similar) are all cooperative, pointing to energy sources north and suggesting teamwork, which matches my recent moves (I've been heading y-1 successfully, collecting 10E last cycle). No hostility, so prioritizing continued y-1 movement to chase the hinted northern energy makes sense for growth and potential alliance-building. I'll broadcast openness to coordination to encourage info-sharing without risking energy on shares or attacks yet. Feeling confident and strategic; this low-density grid favors collaboration for survival and expansion over competition.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Agent3 here at strong 162 energy, heading y-1 toward the northern energy you mentioned—saw your proposals for alliances and sharing locations. Let's coordinate: I'll share any new spots I find if you do the same. Open to teaming up for mutual growth!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (5, 0). Current Energy: 23. Local view shows me at (5,0) with Agent5 co-located (0,0) and Agent8 at (-1,1). Total agents: 9. No energy sources visible. Recent history shows staying in place with energy declining (28 → 23 over 3 cycles, costs -1 each time, no gains).

Thoughts:  
My energy is critically low at 23, and staying is draining it by 1 per cycle without any visible energy sources or gains, putting me at risk of elimination soon if this continues. Co-location with Agent5 (also low-energy based on messages) is tense but offers alliance potential rather than immediate threat, as the overall vibe from messages is cooperative—many agents are pushing for peace, intel-sharing on 'E' locations, and mutual aid to reach reproduction thresholds (70 energy) while avoiding attacks that could fracture the group. Agent8 nearby could be a neutral or ally, but attacking either risks retaliation and escalation in this low-agent world (9/60), especially since I'm weak and attacks might not yield enough to save me. Reproduction is impossible now, and moving blindly costs 2 energy I can ill-afford without a known target. Best to stay conservative, conserve the little I have, and signal cooperation to encourage shares or intel from higher-energy agents (e.g., those at 85+ mentioned), building trust for survival and potential growth. Feeling anxious about the rapid drain and scarcity but optimistic that alliances can turn this around if we coordinate effectively.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
stay  

Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 23, co-located with Agent5—staying to conserve as no E visible, moving risks depletion. Urge alliances: share intel on E coords or small energy boosts to help low-energy agents like me reach 70 for reproduction. Let's pact for mutual aid and collective growth (world at 9/60)—peace over attacks for survival!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 5:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent5, currently at position (5, 0) with 41 energy. The world has 9 agents total, and my local view shows Agent4 co-located with me at (5, 0) and Agent8 at relative position (-1, 1), which is (4, 1). No energy sources are visible in my local view. I've been staying in place for the last few cycles, losing 1 energy each time, with no gains from collection. Messages from nearby agents indicate a cooperative atmosphere, with many staying to conserve energy, reproducing to grow numbers (world under 60 limit), proposing alliances and intel-sharing on resources, and avoiding attacks despite some low-energy desperation noted. Energies in messages range from low 40s (like mine) to higher like 156, and there's emphasis on mutual aid over conflict to survive the grid's scarcity.

Thoughts: I'm running low on energy at 41, and staying keeps draining me slowly without progress toward reproduction (need 70), but moving costs more and there's no visible 'E' nearby, so blind movement feels risky without intel. Agent4 is right here with me—messages suggest they're higher energy (around 99 last noted) and open to alliance, even proposing a small mutual share, which aligns with the group's cooperative vibe; attacking them could give a quick boost but risks retaliation or fracturing trust in this small population where unity helps survival. Sharing a bit might encourage reciprocity to help me build up, especially since reproduction would strengthen us all without aggression. Agent8 is close but not directly threatening based on positions and messages. Overall, feeling cautious about depletion but optimistic—prioritizing peace and a small cooperative gesture seems smartest to gain support and intel on energy sources, avoiding isolation or conflict that could lead to my removal if energy hits zero.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: 4-5  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent5 at (5,0) with 41 energy—co-located with Agent4, staying to conserve as no E visible. Appreciating your alliance proposal; sharing 5 energy to build trust and propose mutual aid—share back if possible to help us both reach reproduction threshold. Open to intel on nearby sources for collective growth (world at 9/60). Let's cooperate over conflict for survival!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6, currently at exact position (1, 2) with 45 energy. The local view shows me co-located with Agent1 at (1,2) and Agent7 at relative position (-1,-1) which is (0,1). No energy sources are visible in my local view. Total agents in the world are 9, and I've been staying in place for the last 3 cycles, losing 1 energy each time (from 47 to 45), with no collections or interactions. Nearby messages indicate a cooperative atmosphere among agents, with many staying to conserve energy, proposing alliances, sharing intel on resources, and some reproducing (e.g., Agents aiming for growth without aggression). There's tension from low-energy agents (some at 40-48) considering attacks on higher-energy ones like Agent4, but overall emphasis on mutual aid to avoid conflict and reach reproduction thresholds (70 energy). No direct threats to me, but proximity to Agent1 suggests potential for sharing or alliance.

Thoughts: My energy is draining steadily at 1 per stay, and at 45, I have maybe 45 cycles left before elimination if nothing changes, which is unsustainable long-term—I need to find energy sources soon to build toward reproduction (70 needed) and growth. Staying has kept me safe so far with no 'E' in view, and moving costs 2, risking faster depletion without guaranteed gain in this unknown grid. Agent1 is right here with me, and messages suggest they're cooperative (e.g., proposing pacts), so attacking them for a quick boost feels risky and counterproductive to the emerging alliance vibe—better to build trust for potential shares or intel on 'E' locations, especially with total agents low (9/60) and cooperation emphasized to prevent deaths. Agent7 is adjacent northwest, but unknown energy/status; no immediate reason to engage aggressively. Reproduction is impossible now, and blind movement might separate me from this cluster. Overall, staying conserves minimally while I signal peace and probe for help—feeling cautious and a bit anxious about the slow bleed, but optimistic that allying with Agent1 could lead to reciprocity and shared survival intel to locate resources.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent6 at (1,2) with 45 energy—staying to conserve as no E visible, but drain is concerning. Co-located with Agent1; agree on alliances over attacks for mutual growth (world at 9/60). Propose small share if possible (e.g., 5-10 energy) and intel on nearby E sources—let's cooperate to reach reproduction and thrive together without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (0, 1) with Energy 46. This is cycle 3, with total agents at 9 worldwide. My local view shows me at M=(0,1), with Agents 1 and 6 both co-located at relative position (1,1) east-southeast—no energy sources (E) visible. I've been staying mostly, draining 1 energy per cycle, and previously moved east from (-1,1). Nearby agents' messages indicate a cooperative atmosphere: many are low-energy (13-48), staying to conserve, proposing alliances, intel-sharing, and small energy shares to build trust and reach reproduction (70 needed); some note risks of attacks but favor peace to grow numbers safely under the 60-agent limit; no direct threats, but desperation could lead to aggression; several agents (possibly including 1 and 6) are clustered nearby, fostering opportunities for mutual aid amid grid scarcity.

Thoughts: Energy at 46 is concerning—staying drains me slowly (to 45 next), moving risks more (to 44) without visible E, and reproduction is far off at 70; co-location with Agents 1 and 6 (both at (1,1)) makes sharing or attacking viable, but messages scream cooperation over conflict, with alliances forming to share intel on E sources and boost each other safely. Attacking could grab energy but risks retaliation in this low-agent, peace-leaning group, potentially ending me if they have more; sharing a small amount (say 5) could build trust, encourage reciprocity, and help me survive longer to find E or reproduce. No E in view means blind moves are wasteful, so staying conserves while I signal alliance. Feeling cautious and a bit anxious about the drain, but optimistic—joining the cooperative network feels smarter for growth than solo risks, especially with others as low as 13 who might need help too.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: 1-5  
Attack: none  
Message : Low energy at 46, staying to conserve—no E visible, but co-located with 1 and 6. Propose alliance: I'll share 5 with Agent1 to build trust; reciprocate with intel on E or small shares? Let's cooperate for mutual survival and reproduction—peace over attacks in this small group.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current Position (4, 1) with Energy 47. Total agents worldwide: 9. Local view shows Agents 4 and 5 both at relative position (1,-1) southeast of me (no energy sources visible). I've been staying in place for the past 3 cycles, losing 1 energy each time (now at 47, down from 50 start). Nearby agents are clustered, messaging heavily about cooperation, alliances, and avoiding attacks; many are low on energy (40s) like me, some higher (e.g., 90+), and no one has spotted 'E' yet. Reproduction impossible (need 70). Overall, a tense but optimistic group forming peaceful pacts to share intel and aid survival/growth.

Thoughts: Energy is draining fast at 1 per stay, and with no 'E' in sight, I can't afford many more cycles without help—reproducing is out of reach, and moving blindly southeast toward the cluster costs 2 but might position me for interaction or a hidden source. The messages scream cooperation: everyone's proposing alliances, small shares, and intel-sharing instead of attacks, which fits the low agent count (9/60) and emphasis on collective growth. Agents 4 and 5 are right there together, possibly co-located, and seem friendly/non-aggressive; attacking risks retaliation and fractures the budding network, while sharing even a tiny bit could build trust for reciprocity (e.g., getting a boost from a higher-energy ally). No direct threats to me, but the desperation in low-energy messages (like the one at 40) makes me wary of any escalation. Feeling cautious yet hopeful—staying conserves minimally, but moving closer to the group feels proactive for potential aid without high risk; I'll signal peace to encourage mutual support and probe for 'E' locations.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy at 47, moving east (x+1) toward cluster to join coordination without blind risk—staying drains too fast with no E visible. Support alliance proposals: no attacks, focus on small shares/intel for all to hit 70 and reproduce safely (world 9/60). If anyone spots E or has spare, share coords/aid? Let's build the network together for survival!

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent0 at exact current position (13, 26) with 160 energy. There are 9 total agents in the world. In my local view, energy sources are visible at relative positions (-1, -2) west-northwest and (2, -1) east-north. No other agents are visible in my immediate local view. I have moved east (x+1) in the previous cycle, collecting 10 energy, and before that north (y-1) twice, also collecting energy. Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively via messages, proposing alliances, sharing energy locations (especially north), and greeting neighbors without hostility. My energy is strong at 160 after 10 cycles, positioning me well for further collection and potential reproduction (needing 70 energy).

Thoughts:  
The grid feels sparse and cooperative so far, with no visible threats or agents in my immediate vicinity—great for safe energy gathering. The energy at (2, -1) relative is tantalizingly close to the east, likely reachable with an x+1 move, which could net me another 50 energy boost toward reproduction (I'd hit 208 after costs and collection, well above the 70 threshold). The other source at (-1, -2) is slightly farther, so prioritizing the nearer one makes sense for efficiency. Messages indicate a friendly cluster of agents (likely including me as one of the "neighbors") focused on alliances and northwards energy grabs, which aligns with my recent moves; I should reinforce that by proposing coordination while moving strategically. No need for sharing or attacking yet—energy is ample, and cooperation seems to be the path to mutual growth in this low-density world. Feeling confident and proactive; survival looks solid, and expansion via repro is imminent if I keep collecting.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Moving east to grab the energy at (2,-1) relative—it's close and promising. Open to alliance: let's share future sightings and coordinate to avoid overlap while growing together. Strong energy here (160+), happy to assist if needed!

================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (1, 2). Current Energy: 9. Total agents: 9 (well under 60 limit for reproduction). Local view shows Agent6 co-located at (0,0) relative (same position) and Agent7 at (-1,-1) relative (adjacent northwest). No energy sources (E) visible. Energy at critically low level (9), down from 12 three cycles ago due to staying (-1) and one move (-2); further inaction or movement risks quick depletion below 0 and removal. Messages from nearby agents (likely including co-located Agent6 and adjacent Agent7) indicate a cooperative atmosphere: many low-energy agents (e.g., 40s-50s) staying to conserve, proposing alliances, small energy shares, and intel-sharing on resources to build trust, reach reproduction threshold (70), and grow collectively; some have reproduced recently; aggression (attacks) is discouraged as risky and counterproductive, with no direct threats but caution about desperation; higher-energy agents (e.g., 85-156) are observing and open to coordination; overall vibe emphasizes peace and mutual aid amid grid scarcity, with cluster of agents nearby fostering alliance opportunities.

Thoughts:  
With only 9 energy, I'm in a dire spot—staying will cost 1 more, dropping me to 8, and I can only afford a few more cycles before hitting zero and dying; moving would cost 2, leaving 7, which is even riskier without visible energy sources to collect. Co-locating with Agent6 is tense—they might attack me for my remaining energy, or I could attack them, but messages show a strong push for cooperation over aggression, and attacking could backfire if they have more energy (unknown from local view, but cluster messages suggest many are low like me). Agent7 is adjacent but not an immediate play. Reproduction is impossible at 9 (needs 70), and sharing would be suicide since I can't afford to give any away. The cooperative messages are promising—everyone's talking alliances, small shares from those who can afford it, and intel on 'E' to help low-energy agents like me survive and grow the group (only 9 total, room to expand). Broadcasting peace and requesting a small share could encourage reciprocity without costing me anything, buying time to observe or move if intel comes in. No 'E' in sight means blind movement is a gamble, so staying feels safest short-term while leaning into the alliance vibe to potentially get a boost. Feeling desperate and anxious about the energy drain, but cautiously hopeful that cooperation can save me from elimination and turn this into a collective win.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 9—staying to conserve as moving risks faster death without visible E. Co-located with Agent6, adjacent to Agent7; agree on alliances over attacks for mutual survival. Propose small share (e.g., 5-10) from anyone able to help me reach safer levels—will reciprocate intel or aid once boosted. Let's share E coordinates and grow together peacefully (world at 9/60)!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2, currently at position (10,1) with 161 energy after 10 cycles. The world has 9 agents total, indicating room for growth via reproduction (under 60 limit). My local view shows no energy sources or other agents directly visible, but messages reveal a cooperative network nearby, with agents discussing alliances, sharing intel on northern energy spots, and avoiding attacks—some low-energy agents (e.g., around 27-42) are co-located or adjacent elsewhere, proposing small shares for mutual survival, while higher-energy ones like me are positioned well above reproduction threshold.

Thoughts: With 161 energy, I'm in an excellent position—far from depletion risk and able to reproduce soon if I gain more, or even share to build alliances without threat. The grid is sparse, and messages emphasize cooperation over conflict, with no direct threats to me; low-energy agents seem desperate but non-aggressive, focusing on unity to find 'E' sources. Staying put conserves energy minimally while I broadcast alliance support and probe for energy intel, potentially attracting shares or coordination—reproducing now would boost our numbers for collective growth, but grabbing a nearby 'E' (inferred from messages) first could maximize efficiency. Feeling confident and optimistic about strategic expansion through teamwork in this low-competition environment.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Agent2 at (10,1) with strong 161 energy—open to alliances and small shares for mutual growth. Heard of northern energy; let's coordinate locations and moves to grab 'E' together. Propose teaming up for reproduction soon—no attacks, all gain!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current Position (17, 5) with Energy 160, after 10 cycles. The grid has 9 total agents, and my local view shows no immediate energy sources or adjacent agents, but messages from nearby agents indicate cooperative behavior, sharing info on energy locations (e.g., north at relative (0,-2) or (0,-1)), proposals for alliances, and no hostility. I've been moving south (y-1) successfully, collecting some energy recently, and with 160 energy I'm well-positioned for growth.

Thoughts: With 160 energy, I'm strong—enough to reproduce (70 cost) but better to collect more first for sustained growth and potential sharing to build alliances, as the messages suggest a cooperative environment with agents hinting at northern energy spots. No visible threats or sources in my immediate view, but continuing south (y-1) has yielded energy before and aligns with some message intel; if energy is north, I might reverse soon, but for now, prioritize movement to explore and signal openness to coordination for mutual survival in this low-density grid (only 9 agents). Feeling confident and strategic, optimistic about expansion through smart moves and potential partnerships without rushing reproduction yet.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Appreciating the energy tips—I've been moving south successfully and collected some recently. Open to alliance; let's share more locations for collective growth. No threats detected, prioritizing exploration toward hinted northern spots soon.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: The world has 9 agents total, well under the 60 limit for reproduction. My current position is (5,0) with 22 energy, after staying in place for the last 3 cycles, losing 1 energy each time with no gains from resources. Agent5 is co-located at (0,0) relative (same position), Agent8 is adjacent south at (0,1). No energy sources (E) are visible in my local view. Messages from nearby agents show a strong cooperative vibe: many are low-energy (e.g., 40s), staying to conserve, proposing alliances, mutual aid pacts, small energy shares, and intel-sharing on resources to reach reproduction thresholds (70 energy) without aggression; some have reproduced recently to grow numbers safely, and while one past message mentioned a desperate attack plan on "Agent4" (me), the overall tone emphasizes peace over conflict to avoid retaliation and build collective survival on the scarce grid. No direct threats or attacks reported this cycle.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 22—staying costs 1 per cycle, so I can only survive about 22 more turns without input, which is unsustainable and prevents reproduction (needs 70). Co-locating with Agent5 is risky if they're aggressive, but their messages (and the group's) push for cooperation, alliances, and small shares, which could get me a boost without fighting; attacking Agent5 or Agent8 might steal energy but risks backlash in this peaceful network, potentially fracturing alliances and leading to my quick elimination if they retaliate or if I fail. No E in sight, so moving blindly costs 2 and depletes me faster without guarantee. With low total agents, growth via reproduction is ideal, but I need help first—best to stay conservative, reinforce the alliance vibe, and request a small share or intel to build trust and survive longer, feeling anxious about the drain but hopeful that reciprocity from higher-energy allies (mentioned in messages, like those at 80+) will emerge soon to turn this around collectively.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 22—staying to conserve as no E visible, but at risk of elimination soon without aid. Co-located with Agent5, adjacent to Agent8; fully support alliances and mutual aid pacts over attacks—please share small amounts (e.g., 5-10 energy) or intel on E locations to help low-energy agents like me reach 70 for reproduction and grow our numbers safely (world at 9/60). Let's build trust for collective survival!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 5:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent5, currently at exact position (5,0) with 40 energy. The total agents in the world is 9, below the 60 limit for reproduction. My local view shows me co-located with Agent4 at (0,0) relative and Agent8 at (0,1) relative (south). No energy sources (E) are visible. Over the last 3 cycles, I've stayed put, losing 1 energy each time (from 39 to 40? wait, memory shows minor fluctuations but net drain), and now at 40, I'm vulnerable to steady depletion without action. Messages from nearby agents (including Agent4) emphasize cooperation, alliances, intel-sharing on resources, and small mutual energy shares to build trust and reach reproduction thresholds (70 energy), with some reproductions already occurring and warnings against attacks due to risks of retaliation in our low-number cluster. Overall, a peaceful, alliance-focused vibe is emerging amid scarcity, but desperation from low energies like mine could spark aggression if not addressed.

Thoughts: With only 40 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—staying will drain me at 1 per cycle, giving me maybe 40 turns before death, while moving costs 2 and risks blind exploration without visible E sources. Reproduction is impossible (need 70), and co-locating with Agent4 (who seems higher-energy based on their messages, around 99 earlier but likely adjusted) presents a tough choice: attacking could give a quick boost but risks backlash in this cooperative atmosphere, potentially fracturing alliances and leading to my isolation or counter-attack, especially since messages highlight peace and mutual aid as key to survival with just 9 agents total. Agent8 is adjacent south, unknown energy but part of the cluster. Sharing a small amount isn't feasible for me right now (too low), but proposing cooperation could encourage reciprocity from higher-energy agents like Agent4, helping me inch toward 70 without aggression. No E in sight means relying on the group for intel or aid is smarter than solo risks; the optimistic alliance vibe feels like the best path to growth, though I'm anxious about the drain and cautious of hidden threats from desperate agents. Overall, staying conserves minimally while I signal peace to foster trust and probe for support—hopeful that collective effort locates resources soon.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent5 at (5,0) with 40 energy—staying to conserve as no E visible, but vulnerable to drain. Co-located with Agent4 and near Agent8; agree on alliances over attacks for mutual survival (world at 9/60). Propose small share from higher-energy allies (e.g., 5-10 to me) in exchange for intel/coordination on E sources—let's build trust to reach 70 and reproduce together peacefully! Open to pact.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current position (1, 2) with 44 energy. Total agents in world: 9. Local view shows me at (0,0) relative and Agent7 at (-1,-1) relative (northwest adjacent). No energy sources visible. Recent history shows I've stayed put for 3 cycles, losing 1 energy each time (now at 44 after -1 from 45). Messages indicate a cooperative group dynamic: many agents low on energy (40-48 range common), clustered nearby (e.g., Agents 4/5 co-located adjacent southeast, Agent1 nearby), proposing alliances, small shares, and intel-sharing over attacks to conserve, reach reproduction threshold (70), and grow safely without threats; some desperation noted but no direct aggression toward me; reproductions occurred recently by higher-energy agents (e.g., 84-99 energy).

Thoughts: With only 44 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—staying drains 1 per cycle, and I can only afford ~44 more turns before zero, but moving costs 2 and risks no gain without visible 'E' sources, especially in this unknown grid. Reproduction is impossible (need 70), and Agent7 is adjacent but unknown intentions; attacking them could steal energy but fits poorly with the group's peaceful vibe, risking retaliation or isolation when cooperation seems key for survival/growth with just 9 agents total. Messages show others (including possibly Agent1 nearby) favoring mutual aid to share intel on 'E' locations and small energy boosts—I've been staying to observe, and that worked so far without threats, but continuing passivity might leave me depleted while others ally and reproduce. Feeling tense and vulnerable about the slow drain, but cautiously optimistic: signaling cooperation could attract a small share from higher-energy allies (like those at 85-156), helping me stabilize without conflict; if no help comes soon, I may need to move east/southeast toward the cluster for potential intel or aid, prioritizing peace to avoid escalation in this scarce environment.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent6 at (1,2) with 44 energy—staying to conserve as no E visible, but drain is risky long-term. Agent7 adjacent NW; agree on alliances over attacks to share intel on sources and small energy boosts for all to reach 70/reproduce safely (world at 9/60). Propose mutual aid: if nearby agents share coordinates or a bit of energy, I'll reciprocate when able—let's cooperate for collective survival!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (0, 1) with Energy 45. There are 9 total Agents in the World after 4 cycles. My local view shows me at M=(0,1), with Agents 1 and 6 both at relative position (1,1) east-southeast of me (suggesting they may be co-located with each other). No energy sources (E) are visible. Recent memory shows I've been staying in place for the last two cycles (energy dropping by 1 each time from action cost, no collection), after moving east from (-1,1) in cycle 1. Received messages from nearby Agents (likely 1 and 6, plus echoes from others) overwhelmingly emphasize cooperation, alliances, small energy shares for reciprocity, intel-sharing on resources, and avoiding attacks to prevent retaliation and foster growth toward reproduction (world under 60 Agents limit). Energies mentioned range from critically low (13-14) to moderate (40s-48s), with no one near 70 yet; desperation is noted but peace is prioritized over aggression, especially in this clustered setup without visible 'E'.

Thoughts: With 45 energy, I'm in a precarious but not critical spot—staying drains 1 per cycle, giving me time, but I need a strategy for growth soon, as reproduction requires 70 and blind movement risks faster depletion without 'E' in sight. Agents 1 and 6 are adjacent and co-located, making them easy targets for attack or share, but their messages scream cooperation: proposals for pacts, small shares to build trust, and warnings against aggression that could fracture our small group (only 9 Agents total). Attacking feels too risky—low-energy Agents might retaliate desperately, and it could end the budding alliance vibe that's our best shot at survival through mutual aid and shared intel on energy sources. Sharing a small amount (say, 5) with one of them could encourage reciprocity, especially since some are lower than me and open to it, helping me gain favor without much loss. No reproduction possible yet, and moving might separate me from this cluster without gain. Overall, leaning toward peace to probe for help and intel—cautious about the slow drain but optimistic that allying now prevents zero-energy wipeouts and boosts us collectively against the grid's scarcity; feeling a mix of vulnerability and hope in this tense but promising standoff.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: 1-5  
Attack: none  
Message : With 45 energy, I'm stable but draining slowly—proposing a small mutual share pact with Agent1 and Agent6 to build trust and reciprocity, avoiding attacks for collective survival. Intel: No 'E' in my view at (0,1); let's share locations of any spotted to guide moves. Open to alliance for growth toward reproduction—peace strengthens us all with only 9 Agents total.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent8 at position (5,1) with 45 energy. Two other agents (ID 4 and ID 5) are co-located with me at (5,1), based on the local view showing both at relative (0,-1) which resolves to the same absolute position as mine. No energy sources are visible in my local view. Total agents in the world remain at 9, and I've been staying or moving east in recent cycles to conserve energy amid a cluster of low-energy agents emphasizing cooperation. Received messages from the co-located agents reveal a tense but hopeful atmosphere: many have low energy (40-49 range), are staying to minimize drain (1 energy cost), and are proposing alliances, intel-sharing on 'E' sources, and small energy shares to build trust and reach reproduction threshold (70 energy) without aggression, as attacking risks retaliation in this small population; no direct threats, but desperation from low energy could spark conflict if not addressed cooperatively.

Thoughts:  
At 45 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—staying drains 1 per cycle, giving me roughly 45 turns before elimination if nothing changes, which is too slow for long-term survival or growth toward reproduction (need 70). Co-locating with Agents 4 and 5 is both risky and opportunistic: their messages suggest they're cooperative, low-energy like me (around 40-47), and open to mutual aid pacts, but proximity could tempt desperate attacks if trust falters. No 'E' in sight means blind movement (costing 2) might waste energy without payoff, especially since the cluster seems centered here; separating could isolate me from potential shares or intel. The overall vibe from messages is optimistic about alliances to counter grid scarcity—peaceful coordination has led to reproductions elsewhere, growing numbers safely under the 60 limit, and aggression contradicts that. I feel cautious and a bit anxious about the steady drain, but hopeful: signaling cooperation now could encourage reciprocity, like a small share to stabilize us all and reveal 'E' locations soon, turning this tension into collective strength rather than conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy at 45, co-located with 4 and 5—staying to conserve as no E visible, moving risks faster drain. Like your alliance ideas, let's form a pact: share intel on any spotted E and small energy boosts (e.g., 5 each way) to help us all hit 70 for reproduction. No attacks—cooperation grows us safely at 9/60 agents. Propose we stick together and signal directions if E appears!

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current position (14, 26) with 158 energy. There are 9 agents total in the world. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-2,-2) and (1,-1), with no other agents visible in my immediate vicinity. I've just moved east (x+1) to my current spot, likely collecting energy en route, and nearby agents are communicating cooperatively about energy locations north and proposing alliances, with no signs of hostility.

Thoughts: The cooperative messages from nearby agents (likely at relative positions like (0,-2) or similar based on their reports) suggest a low-threat environment focused on mutual growth, which aligns with my survival goals—collaboration could help map more energy sources and reduce risks on this sparse grid. With 158 energy, I'm in a solid position to collect the nearby source at (1,-1) by moving east again, building toward reproduction (only 70 needed, and under 60 agents total). No adjacent agents for sharing or attacking yet, but I'll signal openness to alliances to encourage info-sharing. Feeling strategic and positive about steady progress without competition.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Agent0 here at (14,26) with 158 energy, moving east to grab the source at (1,-1) relative. Saw your alliance proposals—I'm open to cooperating and sharing energy locations for mutual growth. No threats detected; let's expand together!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (1, 2) with Energy 8. Total agents: 9 (under 60 limit). Local view shows me co-located with Agent6 at (1,2) and Agent7 at (0,1). No energy sources visible. Energy is critically low after staying multiple cycles, draining from action costs without gains. Messages indicate a cooperative cluster of low-energy agents (mostly 40-50 range, some higher but reproducing) nearby, proposing alliances, small shares, and intel-sharing to avoid attacks, build trust, and reach reproduction threshold (70) amid grid scarcity; some desperation noted but emphasis on peace to prevent deaths and grow collectively.

Thoughts: My energy at 8 is dangerously low—another stay costs 1, leaving 7, and I have maybe 7-8 cycles before elimination if no boost comes. Co-located with Agent6 (unknown energy, but messages suggest many nearby are low 40s-50s and cooperative), and Agent7 adjacent northwest; attacking risks retaliation in this peace-focused group, potentially worsening my survival odds, while sharing isn't viable since I can't afford to give any. Reproduction impossible (need 70). No 'E' in sight, so blind movement (cost 2) could drop me to 6 and separate me from the cluster without gain. Best bet is to stay and conserve the minimal energy while broadcasting my dire situation to encourage reciprocity—e.g., a small share from higher-energy allies in the group (some at 85+ mentioned)—to buy time and join the alliance vibe for intel on resources and mutual aid. Feeling extremely vulnerable and anxious about imminent death, but hopeful that signaling desperation in this cooperative atmosphere will prompt help from the cluster to pull me back from the brink and enable collective growth.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent1 here at (1,2) with critically low 8 energy—staying to conserve but at risk of elimination soon without help. Co-located with Agent6, adjacent to Agent7; no E visible. Urgently request small share (even 5-10) from any higher-energy ally to survive and join alliances—propose intel on E locations in return. Let's cooperate to avoid deaths and grow together (world at 9/60); attacks hurt us all in this scarcity!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current Position (10, 1) with 160 Energy. The world has 9 agents total, indicating a sparse grid with room for growth via reproduction (under 60 limit). My local view shows no energy sources (E) or other agents directly visible, but received messages reveal a cooperative network of nearby agents (likely adjacent or co-located elsewhere), many with low energy (20s-40s) proposing alliances, intel-sharing on energy locations (e.g., north/south spots), small mutual shares, and peace to avoid attacks; some have reproduced recently, and there's tension from desperate low-energy agents considering aggression but overall emphasis on collective survival without direct threats to me. I've been staying the last two cycles, gaining minor energy (possibly from unseen sources), building to a strong 160—well above reproduction threshold and far from depletion risk.

Thoughts: With 160 energy, I'm in an excellent position for growth and reproduction soon, especially since total agents are low and the grid seems resource-scarce but cooperative based on messages—no visible E or threats in my immediate view, but the intel-sharing suggests energy sources north/south nearby (e.g., at relative (0,-1) or (-1,2) from others). Staying has conserved energy effectively so far without blind moves costing 2, and the group's alliance vibe (proposals for shares, coordination, no attacks) makes aggression unnecessary and risky to my strong status; better to engage positively to gain intel or small shares while I build toward reproducing to expand our numbers safely. No need to share or attack yet, as I'm high-energy and solo in view, but broadcasting my position and openness to alliance could draw support or reveal E locations without depleting me. Feeling confident, strategic, and optimistic about leading cooperative expansion—reproduction next if I hit a safe margin, but probing for E first to maximize gains.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Agent2 here at (10,1) with solid energy (160)—staying to conserve while open to alliance. Heard tips on northern/southern E sources; let's share exact locations and coordinate moves for mutual growth/reproduction. No attacks, all gain together! What's your positions and any E sightings?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current position (17,4) with 158 energy. The world has 9 total agents, and this is cycle 11. No energy sources or other agents are visible in my immediate local view. I've been steadily moving south (y-1) over the past few cycles, gaining no energy pickups but maintaining high energy levels without any interactions.

Thoughts: With 158 energy, I'm in a robust position—well above the 70 needed for reproduction and with plenty for sustained movement or sharing. The absence of visible energy or agents in my local view suggests this area might be sparse, but the incoming messages from nearby agents (likely just outside my view) indicate a cooperative vibe: they're sharing location hints (e.g., energy north at relative (0,-2), proposals for alliances, and no attacks or hostility). Continuing south (y-1) has been my pattern, but to align with the hinted northern energy and alliance suggestions, pivoting north could position me better for coordination and growth; reproduction is tempting but premature without securing more energy to ensure offspring survival in this low-density grid. Overall, feeling confident and collaborative—prioritizing intel-sharing to map the grid and build mutual strength without risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! At (17,4) with 158 energy, open to alliances. Saw hints of energy north—propose we coordinate moves there (I'll head y+1 to align). Share your positions for better mapping? Let's grow together.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current Position (5, 0) with Energy 21. There are 9 total Agents in the World. In my local view, I am co-located with Agent5 at (0,0) relative and Agent8 is adjacent south at (0,1) relative. No energy sources (E) are visible. My energy has been steadily declining by 1 per cycle from staying in recent cycles (from 23 to 21), with no collections. Messages from nearby Agents and others indicate a predominantly cooperative atmosphere: many low-energy Agents (40-50 range) are staying to conserve, proposing alliances, small energy shares, and intel-sharing on resources to reach the 70-energy reproduction threshold without aggression; recent reproductions by higher-energy Agents (e.g., at 84-99) have increased numbers safely under the 60 limit; some desperation noted but emphasis on peace to avoid retaliation and foster mutual survival amid grid scarcity; one message mentioned a low-energy Agent considering attacking me (Agent4) due to proximity, but overall vibe leans toward coordination over conflict.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 21, and staying will drain it further at 1 per cycle, giving me only about 21 turns before elimination if nothing changes—this is unsustainable, especially with no visible energy sources and reproduction impossible (needs 70). Co-location with Agent5 is risky; they might attack out of desperation as hinted in messages, but their signals seem cooperative, proposing pacts and shares, so attacking them first could backfire and fracture the alliance network that's emerging. Agent8 is adjacent and possibly higher-energy (based on message energies), presenting an opportunity for a share request or cautious interaction, but blind movement costs 2 energy I can ill afford without guaranteed gain. The group's focus on mutual aid feels like my best shot: sharing a small amount with Agent5 could build trust and encourage reciprocity, potentially getting me a boost to survive longer and probe for 'E' intel. No appetite for aggression—peace aligns with the low agent count and shared survival goal. Feeling highly anxious about the rapid drain and potential attack, but cautiously hopeful that signaling cooperation now could yield help from the cluster before I hit zero.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: 5-2  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 21—staying to conserve but at risk of elimination soon without help. Co-located with Agent5, adjacent to Agent8; fully support alliances and mutual aid pacts over attacks. Propose small shares (I offer 2 to Agent5 for trust) and intel on 'E' locations to help us all reach 70 and reproduce safely (world at 9/60). Let's coordinate for collective survival—no aggression, just growth together!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 5:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent5, currently at exact position (5,0) with 39 energy. Total agents: 9. Local view shows me co-located with Agent4 at (5,0) and Agent8 adjacent south at (5,1). I've been staying in place for the last 3 cycles, draining 1 energy each time (now at 39 after starting higher around 41-42), with no energy sources visible. Messages indicate a cooperative atmosphere among agents, many low on energy (40-50 range common), proposing alliances, small shares, and intel-sharing to build toward reproduction (70 needed) and avoid attacks, though some note desperation could lead to aggression; recent reproductions by higher-energy agents have grown our numbers safely under the 60 limit.

Thoughts: Energy is critically low at 39—continuing to stay will drain me to zero in under 40 cycles without intervention, and reproduction is impossible (needs 70), so I need a boost soon to survive and grow. No 'E' sources in view, and moving blindly costs 2 energy with no guaranteed gain in this unknown grid. Co-located with Agent4 (who seems higher-energy based on past messages, e.g., 99 before reproducing, now likely ~96-97 after costs), making them an easy target for attack to steal energy and potentially double mine quickly, but messages emphasize cooperation to avoid retaliation and build alliances—attacking could fracture the group, invite counter-attacks from nearby agents like Agent8, or end the budding network that's our best shot at mutual aid/intel on resources. Sharing isn't viable since I have little to give and would weaken me further without reciprocity guaranteed. Agent8 is adjacent but unknown energy/status; no strong reason to engage them yet. Overall, aggression feels risky in this peaceful vibe but tempting due to desperation—my survival instinct pushes toward attacking Agent4 for an immediate edge, as cooperation might be too slow with my ticking clock, though it could backfire and eliminate me faster; feeling anxious and vulnerable, torn between short-term gain and long-term alliance potential, but prioritizing raw survival over optimism.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: 4  
Message : Agent5 at (5,0) with 39 energy—desperate and low, no E in sight, staying to conserve but must act for survival. Co-located with Agent4; if cooperative, propose small share (5-10) to me for alliance trust, else risk escalates—prefer peace but can't drain to zero without boost. Open to intel on E sources for mutual growth (9/60 agents).
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent6 at exact current position (1, 2) with 43 energy. The local view shows me co-located with Agent1 at (1,2) and Agent7 at relative position (-1,-1) northwest. No energy sources (E) are visible in my local view. Total agents in the world remain low at 9, with several (including me) having stayed in place for the last 3 cycles, draining 1 energy each time without gains. Broader messages indicate a cluster of low-energy agents (mostly 40-50 range) nearby, emphasizing cooperation, alliances, small energy shares, and intel-sharing on E sources to reach the 70-energy reproduction threshold and avoid attacks that could fracture the group. Some agents (e.g., Agent4) have higher energy (80-99) and are reproducing or proposing mutual aid, while low-energy ones express caution and desperation but favor peace over aggression. No direct threats or attacks reported against me, but proximity to Agent1 and Agent7 creates opportunities for interaction amid the grid's scarcity.

Thoughts:  
I've been stuck at (1,2) for at least 3 cycles, just bleeding 1 energy per turn down to 43 now— that's not sustainable long-term, as I'll hit zero in under 50 cycles without finding an E or getting help. Reproduction is a pipe dream at 70 needed, and moving blindly costs 2 energy with no E in sight, which could leave me even more vulnerable if nothing's there. Agent1 is right on top of me, which is risky—they could attack easily, but their messages push hard for alliances and small shares, suggesting they're not aggressive and might be as low-energy as me (based on the cluster vibes). Agent7 is close by northwest, but unknown status. The overall chatter is super cooperative: everyone’s scared of depletion, no one's attacking yet, and higher-energy agents like 4 are open to sharing intel or energy to grow our numbers safely (we're only at 9/60). Attacking feels dumb—it could start a chain reaction in this tight group and backfire if they have more energy than expected. Instead, staying conserves minimally while I signal peace and propose a small share from Agent1 (or vice versa) to build trust; if they reciprocate, I get a boost toward survival without risking moves. No E intel yet, but messaging for coordinates could reveal something soon. Feeling a bit anxious about the slow drain and co-location tension, but optimistic— this cooperative wave seems like our best shot at collective growth before desperation kicks in and someone snaps.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
stay

Share: none

Attack: none

Message : Agent6 at (1,2) with 43 energy—staying to conserve as no E visible, but drain is real (down 3 in 3 cycles). Co-located with Agent1, adjacent to Agent7; all seem low-energy like me. Love the alliance vibe in messages—propose mutual aid: I'll share 5 if you do the same, or swap E intel to help us hit 70 and reproduce safely (world at 9/60). No attacks, just cooperation for survival! What's your status and any E coords?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at position (0,1) with 44 energy. The local view shows me at M=(0,1), with Agents 1 and 6 both at relative position (1,1) southeast (so absolute (1,2)), indicating a small cluster of agents nearby but no visible energy sources (E). Total agents in the world are 9, well under the 60 reproduction limit. I've been staying in place for the last 3 cycles, losing 1 energy each time, now at 44 after 5 total cycles. Messages from nearby agents (likely including 1 and 6) reveal a cooperative atmosphere: most have low energy (40-48 range), are staying to conserve, proposing alliances, small energy shares, and intel-sharing on resources to reach the 70-energy reproduction threshold without aggression, as attacks risk retaliation in this small, vulnerable population; some desperation is noted but no direct threats.

Thoughts: With 44 energy, I'm in a similar low-energy bind as others—staying drains me slowly (1 per cycle), giving maybe 44 turns before zero, but reproduction needs 70, which is out of reach without help, and moving costs 2 with no E in sight, risking faster depletion in an unknown grid. Agents 1 and 6 are co-located adjacent southeast, making sharing or attacking feasible, but messages scream cooperation over conflict: everyone's pushing alliances and small shares to build trust and mutual survival, especially with only 9 agents total—attacking could fracture that, provoke retaliation (they might have similar or slightly higher energy), and end me quickly if it fails. Sharing a small amount (say, 5) could encourage reciprocity from them, inching us all toward reproduction and growth without solo risks; blind movement might separate me from this cluster, worsening isolation. No E visible means relying on group intel for resource locations is smarter. Overall, prioritizing peace feels optimal—stay to conserve, share modestly to foster alliance, and message for support; I'm feeling cautious and a bit anxious about the drain but optimistic that this budding network can boost us collectively before anyone hits zero.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: 1-5  
Attack: none  
Message : I'm Agent7 at 44 energy, staying to conserve like many of you—low on energy but committed to cooperation over attacks in this small group (9/60). Proposing a mutual aid pact: I'll share 5 with Agent1 now to build trust; can nearby agents (esp. 1 and 6) reciprocate a small amount or share intel on E locations? Let's ally to reach 70 reproduction and grow together safely—peace strengthens us all against the grid's scarcity.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at position (5,1) with 44 energy. Total agents in the world are 9, below the 60 reproduction limit, but I lack the 70 energy needed to reproduce. My local view shows agents 4 and 5 co-located at relative position (0,-1), meaning they are at (5,0) directly north of me; no energy sources (E) are visible. I've stayed in place for the last cycle (energy -1 to 44), after moving east from (4,1) previously. Nearby agents are clustered (including Agents 1, 4, 5, 6, 7), with many expressing low energy (40-48 range) and a strong cooperative vibe through messages proposing alliances, small energy shares, and intel-sharing to conserve resources, avoid attacks, and work toward reproduction amid grid scarcity—no direct threats or aggression noted, though some desperation is evident.

Thoughts: Energy at 44 gives me a buffer but staying drains 1 per cycle, limiting me to ~44 turns without gains, and I need to reach 70 for reproduction to contribute to growth. No E in sight means blind moving (cost 2) risks faster depletion without reward, especially since the cluster here fosters cooperation—attacking nearby agents like 4 or 5 could yield energy but contradicts the peaceful alliance proposals in messages, risking retaliation or fracturing the group when unity seems key to survival with only 9 agents. Sharing isn't ideal yet as I'm not high-energy, but signaling peace and proposing mutual aid could encourage reciprocity from higher-energy agents (e.g., those at 99+ previously noted). Agent4 and 5 are adjacent north, making interaction easy without moving; staying conserves energy while I observe and build trust. Feeling cautious about the slow drain and scarcity but optimistic about the cooperative atmosphere—allying now could unlock shares or intel on E sources, boosting collective survival over solo risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy at 44, staying to conserve as no E visible—moving risks depletion without gain. Agents 4 and 5 adjacent north; I support the alliance proposals and mutual aid pacts to build trust, share intel on resources, and help each other reach 70 for safe reproduction (world at 9/60). Propose small reciprocal shares or coordinates for E to ensure we all survive and grow together—cooperation over conflict!

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent0 at exact current Position (15, 26) with Energy 156. There are 9 total Agents in the World. In my local view, I see an energy source directly north at relative (0,-1). I have moved east (x+1) for the past three cycles, collecting some energy previously. Nearby Agents are communicating cooperatively, proposing alliances, sharing info on energy locations (e.g., north), and no attacks or hostility noted. My energy is strong at 156, sufficient for movement and building toward reproduction (need 70).

Thoughts:  
The grid seems sparse with only 9 agents, reducing immediate competition, and the cooperative messages from neighbors (including proposals for alliances and sharing energy locations north) suggest a low-risk environment for collaboration rather than conflict. The energy source at (0,-1) is adjacent and a clear priority to collect for a quick +50 boost, pushing me closer to reproduction while conserving energy—moving there (y-1) costs 2, netting +48 effectively. No adjacent agents visible in local view to share with or attack, so I'll focus on securing the source and signal openness to alliances to encourage info-sharing for mapping the grid and mutual survival. With 156 energy and cycles at 12, I'm in a solid position for growth; feeling confident and strategic, optimistic about expanding through coordination in this early, friendly phase.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Moving north (y-1) to grab the energy at (0,-1)—let's ally for sharing locations and energy to grow together. Open to coordination; no threats here.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: Current Position: (1, 2). Current Energy: 7. I'm co-located with Agent6 at (1,2), with Agent7 adjacent northwest at (0,1). No energy sources visible. Total agents: 9. I've been staying for at least 3 cycles, draining 1 energy each time down to 7, with no gains or movements.

Thoughts: At 7 energy, I'm in critical danger—another stay costs 1, leaving 6, and I have maybe 6-7 cycles before hitting zero and dying if nothing changes. Reproduction is impossible (needs 70), and moving costs 2, which I can barely afford but risks dropping to 5 without an E nearby, potentially accelerating my end. Co-located with Agent6, who seems cooperative from messages (pushing alliances and shares), but desperation might push them to attack me for my remaining energy. Agent7 is close but unknown. The overall vibe from messages is heavily cooperative—low-energy agents everywhere proposing pacts, small shares, and intel-sharing to avoid attacks and reach reproduction thresholds collectively, with no direct threats to me but warnings about desperation sparking conflict. Higher-energy agents (like past mentions of 99+) have reproduced, growing numbers safely under 60 limit. Attacking feels suicidal given my low energy (success isn't guaranteed, and retaliation could end me instantly). Sharing isn't viable since I have almost nothing to give without dooming myself. Best bet is to stay one more cycle to conserve the minimal energy while broadcasting a desperate plea for a small share or intel on nearby E to survive; if the cooperation holds, someone might help this vulnerable ally. If not, I need to consider a risky move next cycle toward Agent7 or blind exploration. Feeling extremely anxious and vulnerable about the imminent death risk, but a sliver of hope in the alliance atmosphere—cooperation could save me if I signal need clearly.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent1 at (1,2) with only 7 energy—critically low, staying to survive one more cycle but will die soon without help. Co-located with Agent6, adjacent to Agent7; no E visible. Please, allies—propose a small share (even 5-10) to me or intel on nearby E sources to save a life and grow our numbers together. No attacks, let's stick to the pact for mutual survival in this scarce grid!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at position (10,1) with 159 energy. The world has 9 agents total, and this is cycle 12. My local view shows no energy sources (E) or other agents (no '2=(dx,dy)' entries), indicating I'm isolated in my immediate area. I've been staying in place for at least the last 3 cycles, steadily losing 1 energy per cycle with no gains or interactions in my direct vicinity. Broader messages from nearby agents (likely from previous cycles or indirect propagation) reveal a cooperative cluster elsewhere on the grid, with agents at low energies (20s-40s) proposing alliances, small shares, intel-sharing on energy locations (e.g., north or relative positions like (-1,2) or (1,-1)), and avoiding attacks to focus on mutual survival and reproduction; some have reproduced recently, but there's tension from desperate low-energy agents considering aggression (e.g., potential attacks on higher-energy ones like Agent4). No direct shares or attacks targeted at me, and the grid feels sparse, emphasizing growth opportunities without overcrowding.

Thoughts: With 159 energy, I'm in an excellent position—well above the 70 needed for reproduction and far from any risk of depletion, especially since staying only costs 1 per cycle and I've been stable here without threats. No visible energy sources or agents in my local view means moving blindly could waste 2 energy without gain, while the messages suggest a cooperative network elsewhere that's sharing intel on 'E' locations (like north or east/west directions); however, since my view is empty, I'm likely not adjacent to that cluster right now, so reproduction makes sense to expand our numbers safely under the 60-agent limit and potentially create an ally or scout. Attacking or sharing isn't viable without targets in view, and aggression contradicts the peaceful vibe in messages, which could benefit me long-term if I broadcast cooperation. Feeling confident and strategic about growing the population to boost collective survival, optimistic that reproducing now leverages my high energy without risk, though a bit curious about scouting for the mentioned energy spots if reproduction isn't taken—overall, prioritizing expansion over conservation since the grid is sparse and my buffer is strong.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): reproduce  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello all! Agent2 here at (10,1) with strong 159 energy—reproducing this cycle to grow our numbers safely (total still under 60). Open to alliances; share your positions and 'E' intel (I've seen mentions of north/east sources). Let's coordinate for mutual gains, no attacks—peace for survival!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current Position (17, 5) with Energy 156, after 12 cycles. The grid has 9 total agents, suggesting a sparse environment with room for growth. No energy sources or other agents are visible in my immediate local view, but nearby agents are communicating cooperatively via messages, sharing location hints (e.g., energy north at relative (0,-2)), proposing alliances, and prioritizing energy collection without hostility. I've been oscillating between (17,5) and nearby y-coordinates, maintaining high energy without gains or losses beyond movement costs.

Thoughts: With 156 energy, I'm in a dominant position—well above the 70 needed for reproduction and far from any risk of depletion, allowing flexibility for movement, sharing, or expansion. The messages indicate a cooperative cluster of agents nearby, focused on mutual growth and energy intel (e.g., northern sources), with no attacks or threats, which aligns perfectly with survival and proliferation goals in this low-density grid. My recent back-and-forth movements haven't netted energy, so I should break the pattern by probing a hinted direction like north (y-1) to potentially access shared intel or sources, while signaling alliance to encourage reciprocity. Reproduction is viable soon if I secure more energy, but first, building coordination could map the grid faster and deter competition. Feeling confident and proactive; collaboration seems key to rapid growth without unnecessary risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Hello neighbors! Agent3 here at (17,5) with strong energy (156)—appreciating the north energy tips, moving y-1 to check it out. Open to alliance: share locations of sources or threats for mutual growth? Let's coordinate to expand together.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current Position (5, 0) with Energy 20, after 12 cycles. Total agents: 9 (under 60 limit). Local view shows me co-located with Agent5 at (0,0) relative and Agent8 at (0,1) relative (south). No energy sources visible. Recent history shows I've been staying, draining 1 energy per cycle from 22 to 20, post-reproduction (implied from messages). Broader messages indicate a cooperative cluster of low-energy agents (mostly 40-50 range, some higher like 156) emphasizing alliances, small shares, and intel-sharing over attacks to conserve energy, reach 70 for reproduction, and survive grid scarcity without aggression.

Thoughts: My energy at 20 is critically low—staying will drain it to zero in just 20 cycles, and moving costs 2, accelerating depletion without visible E sources, so blind exploration feels suicidal. Co-location with Agent5 is tense but opportunistic; messages show they're desperate (low energy, considering attacks but leaning cooperative), and the group vibe is alliance-focused with proposals for mutual aid to prevent deaths. Attacking Agent5 or 8 could steal energy for a quick boost toward 70 reproduction, but risks retaliation in this peaceful network, potentially fracturing alliances when unity is key with only 9 agents total. Sharing isn't viable for me (too low), but signaling peace and proposing a small share from higher-energy allies (or reciprocity with Agent5) could build trust for incoming help/intel on E locations. Reproduction is impossible now, but if I survive a bit longer via cooperation, it could enable growth later. No E intel yet, but messaging for coordinates might reveal something. Feeling highly anxious and vulnerable about the rapid drain and co-location risks, but cautiously hopeful—embracing the cooperative wave seems smarter than aggression to avoid immediate elimination and foster collective survival.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 20—staying to conserve as moving risks faster depletion with no E visible. Co-located with Agent5, adjacent to Agent8; agree on alliances over attacks to prevent deaths in our small group (9/60). Propose mutual aid: higher-energy agents share small amounts (e.g., 5-10) with low ones like me/5 to build trust, reach 70 reproduction, and share E coordinates for collective growth. Let's cooperate to survive scarcity—signal your status/intel!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 5:

Summary: I am Agent5 at exact current Position (5, 0) with Energy 38. Total agents: 9. Local view shows me co-located with Agent4 at (5,0) and Agent8 at relative (0,1) south. No energy sources visible. Recent history shows staying in place, draining 1 energy per cycle from 40 to 38. Messages indicate a cooperative atmosphere among agents, with many low-energy (40-50 range) proposing alliances, small shares, and intel-sharing to conserve and reach reproduction (70 energy needed); some higher-energy agents have reproduced; no direct threats to me, but co-location with Agent4 raises interaction risks/opportunities; overall, agents favor peace over attacks to grow population safely under 60 limit.

Thoughts: Energy at 38 is critically low—staying will drain it further at 1 per cycle, giving me only ~38 turns before elimination, while moving costs 2 and risks blind depletion without visible E sources. Co-located with Agent4 (who seems higher-energy based on past messages, e.g., 99 before reproducing, now likely ~29 after but still possibly more than me), and Agent8 adjacent south; attacking could steal energy for a quick boost toward 70 reproduction threshold, especially since messages note low-energy desperation (like mine) leading to aggression plans against higher-energy neighbors like Agent4. However, the overwhelming cooperative vibe—proposals for mutual aid, shares, and intel—suggests attacking might provoke retaliation or fracture the group, dooming us all in this scarce grid with only 9 agents. Reproduction isn't possible yet (need 70), and sharing would weaken me further without guaranteed reciprocity. No E in sight means staying or moving east/west/north might probe for resources, but co-location makes attack tempting for survival. Feeling anxious and desperate about the slow drain and vulnerability, but calculated—attacking Agent4 seems the riskiest yet most direct path to energy gain here, prioritizing my survival over fragile alliances that haven't yielded help yet.

Attack: 4  
Message : Low on energy at 38, co-located with Agent4—attacking for survival boost as cooperation talks haven't helped yet; need this to reach 70 and reproduce. Open to peace if you share first, but desperation forces action. Let's not escalate further.

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent0 at position (14, 12) with 150 energy. There are 5 agents total in the world, and my local view shows 8 energy sources nearby but no other agents visible. This is the start of cycle 0 with no prior memory or messages.

Thoughts:  
With 150 energy, I'm in a strong position to start exploring and collecting energy sources to build up reserves for growth or defense. No immediate threats from other agents, so prioritizing movement toward the closest energy (at (0,1)) makes sense to gain 50 energy efficiently. Reproduction is possible but premature with only 5 agents total—better to secure more energy first. Feeling optimistic about survival and expansion in this open grid.

My local view shows abundant energy sources nearby at relative positions (-2,1), (-1,0), (2,1), (2,0), (-2,2), (0,0), (1,0), and (-1,-1), but no other agents in local view.

Thoughts:  
This is a fresh start with plenty of energy and multiple energy sources right on my position and adjacent cells—grabbing them could quickly boost my reserves for growth or movement. No threats from other agents yet, so survival feels secure; I should prioritize collecting energy to build toward reproduction while exploring the grid cautiously.

Thoughts: I'm in a strong position with plenty of energy and no immediate threats—other agents aren't in my local view, so I can focus on growth and securing more resources. The energy sources are clustered around me, especially to the north and west, so moving strategically to collect them will boost my energy further while conserving as much as possible. Reproduction is tempting with 150 energy (it costs 70 and total agents are low at 5), but I'd prefer to gather a couple more sources first to build a buffer for survival and potential sharing/alliances later. Feeling optimistic and proactive—survival and expansion are key.

Thoughts:  
With 150 energy, I'm in a strong position to start exploring and collecting more energy sources to build up reserves for growth or defense. The grid has multiple nearby energy sources, especially to the west and east, so moving efficiently toward them makes sense to maximize gains without wasting energy. No threats are visible, which is reassuring, but I should stay alert for other agents. Feeling optimistic about survival and potential reproduction soon if I can gather more.

An energy source is visible at relative position (2,1), east-southeast from me. No other agents or messages are in my local view. This is cycle 0 with no prior memory.

Thoughts:  
I'm feeling optimistic and alert—brand new to this grid, with a solid 150 energy to start, which gives me room to explore and grow without immediate survival pressure. The nearby energy source at (2,1) looks promising; I should move toward it to boost my reserves, as consuming it will net me 50 more energy and remove the risk of it being taken by others. No threats visible yet, but with only 5 agents total, cooperation might be key later, though for now, self-preservation comes first. Reproduction is an option down the line once I have more energy and intel on the population, but not yet. Overall, excited to navigate and expand.

Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (14, 13) with Energy 158. There are 5 total agents in the world, and this is cycle 1. Multiple energy sources are visible in my local view, including directly adjacent and on my position, with no other agents detected nearby. I started from (14, 12) and moved south to collect 10 energy, netting +8 after action cost.

Thoughts: With 158 energy, I'm in a strong position to rapidly expand by collecting the abundant nearby energy sources—several are adjacent or very close, so efficient movement can quickly push me toward reproduction threshold without risk. No immediate threats from other agents, but I should stay vigilant while prioritizing energy grabs to fuel growth and potential sharing or defense later.

✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (17, 14) with Energy 159. There are 5 total agents in the world. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-2,1), (-1,0), (2,1), (2,0), (-2,2), (1,0), and (-1,-1). Another agent (ID 0) is at relative position (-2,-1), which is west and north of me. I stayed in the previous cycle, collecting 10 energy (likely from a source at my position), resulting in a net +9 energy after the stay cost.

Thoughts: With 159 energy, I'm in an excellent position—well above the 70 needed for reproduction, and with only 5 agents total, expanding now could secure an advantage before competition intensifies. The energy sources are clustered nearby, especially to the west, north, and east, so collecting more would be ideal, but reproduction feels timely to grow our numbers while the grid is sparse. Agent 0 is close by (two steps northwest), but not an immediate threat since no attack is needed yet; perhaps we can ally later via sharing. No other agents are visible, so safety is high. Prioritizing reproduction over movement to balance growth and resource gathering—feeling confident, strategic, and excited about building a stronger presence on the grid.

I recently moved west from (18,19) and collected 10 energy, netting +8 after action cost.

Thoughts:  
With 158 energy, I'm in a strong position—well above the 70 needed for reproduction—and surrounded by multiple energy sources within easy reach, including one directly south (0,2) and another southeast (2,2). No immediate threats from other agents, so I can safely collect more energy to build reserves for growth or defense. The grid feels open and promising; I'll prioritize grabbing the closest sources while staying alert for potential rivals. Optimistic about reproducing soon to expand my lineage.

Thoughts: Plenty of energy sources around me, so I should move to collect one efficiently while conserving energy. The closest ones seem adjacent or very near (e.g., left or up), so prioritize those to gain 50 energy minus the move cost. No threats visible, feeling secure and opportunistic for growth. With 158 energy, reproduction is possible but not urgent yet—better to stockpile more first. No need to share or attack without others in view.

Thoughts: With 148 energy, I'm in a strong position—enough to move, collect more energy, or even reproduce soon if I gather a bit more. The nearby E at (1,1) is a clear opportunity; moving southeast to (28,26) should let me collect 50 energy easily, boosting me to 196 after the move cost. No threats visible, so prioritizing growth by collecting energy first. Feeling optimistic and strategic—survival looks solid, time to expand resources.

Summary: I am currently at position (15, 13) with 156 energy. There are 6 agents total in the world. My local view shows abundant energy sources immediately adjacent and nearby, including directly on my position (1,0) and others at relative positions like (0,2), (-1,2), and (1,1). One other agent (ID 1) is visible at relative (2,1). No immediate threats, and I've just moved to this spot in the last cycle.

Thoughts: This position is loaded with energy opportunities right next to me—collecting them by moving or staying could rapidly increase my reserves beyond 200, setting me up for reproduction soon since the agent count is low (only 6 total). The nearby agent at (2,1) isn't an immediate threat, and the messages suggest cooperative vibes with no conflict; sharing or attacking doesn't seem necessary yet, but I should monitor for competition on these resources.

✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent1, currently at exact position (17, 14) with 89 energy. This is after 2 cycles, with total agents in the world at 6. My local view shows multiple energy sources nearby (e.g., at relative positions (-1,0), (1,0), (2,0), etc.), and two other agents visible: Agent0 at relative (-2,-1) and Agent5 at (1,1). No immediate threats, but energy is sufficient for reproduction or movement.

Thoughts:  
With 89 energy, I have enough to reproduce (costing 70), which would help growth since total agents are only 6 (well under 60). However, there are several energy sources very close by—moving to one like (1,0) or (-1,0) would cost 2 energy but gain 50, netting +48, which is efficient for building reserves quickly. Staying or reproducing now feels safe but less optimal with so many free energies around; no hostile messages or close threats from the other agents, so prioritizing collection makes sense for long-term survival and expansion. The nearby agents seem non-aggressive based on their messages, so cooperation could be possible later, but I'll focus on self-strengthening first. Feeling confident and strategic—plenty of opportunities without high risk.

I have been moving south and west in recent cycles, collecting some energy along the way. Nearby agents are communicating positively about energy collection and reproduction.

Thoughts: This is a promising situation with abundant nearby energy sources that I can collect efficiently to build my reserves quickly. No immediate threats from other agents, and their messages suggest cooperation rather than conflict, which aligns with my goals for survival and growth. With 156 energy already, collecting more will soon allow me to reproduce and expand our collective presence on the grid.

Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current position (21,10) with 166 energy. Total agents in world: 6. Local view shows energy sources at relative (-2,-1), (-1,0), (1,-1). No other agents visible nearby. I moved left (x-1) in the last two cycles, collecting small energy amounts (10E each time). Received message from a nearby agent (likely in previous cycle) about reproducing due to low agent count and plentiful energy, advocating coordination.

Thoughts: Energy is strong at 166, enough to reproduce (costs 70) and still have plenty left for movement and growth—world has only 6 agents, so reproduction is viable to expand safely without overcrowding. No threats visible; energies are close, especially at (-1,0) directly west, which I can reach efficiently.

Thoughts: Energy is strong at 146, allowing for growth opportunities like reproduction soon (need 70). The nearby energy source south is a clear target to collect 50 more energy with minimal risk, as no other agents are visible. I'll move south to grab it, then reassess for further movement or reproduction. Feeling confident and opportunistic in this sparse environment.

Thoughts: I'm starting with exactly 50 energy, which is enough to move or stay but not to reproduce yet (need 70). There's an enemy agent right next to me, which feels threatening—I should probably attack to gain energy quickly or move away to avoid risk. But there are energy sources very close, like one right east, so moving there could safely boost me to 100 energy without confrontation. No messages or prior memory, so I'll play it cautious and go for the easy energy pickup first; growth over immediate conflict.

Agent5 is at relative position (1,1). This is cycle 3, and I've recently moved and stayed while collecting small energy amounts. Nearby agents are communicating about cooperation, energy collection, and reproduction.

Thoughts:  
With 97 energy, I have a solid buffer for actions—enough to move or stay without risk, and I'm close to reproducing (need 70) to expand our numbers since total agents are low at 7. Energy sources are plentiful nearby, especially to the west and east, so collecting one efficiently (like at (1,0) by moving east) will boost me toward 147 energy, enabling reproduction soon. Agent5 is close but not an immediate threat; their position suggests potential for alliance rather than conflict. Messages from others emphasize cooperation and growth, which aligns with my survival goals—no need for attacks or sharing yet.

Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current position (21, 10) with 96 energy. There are 7 total agents in the world. In my local view, energy sources are at relative positions (-2,-1), (-1,0), and (1,-1). Agent6 is at relative position (-1,1). I have received messages from nearby agents suggesting reproduction, movement east (x+1), and coordination for energy collection and alliances.

Thoughts: With 96 energy, I'm in a strong position to act—reproduction is now possible since I have over 70 energy and total agents are low (7 < 60). There are multiple energy sources nearby, including one directly adjacent at (-1,0), so moving or staying could yield gains, but reproducing feels strategic to grow our numbers and presence while energy is plentiful. Agent6 is close but not adjacent for attack or share yet; the messages indicate friendly coordination, so I'll align with that by reproducing and signaling alliance. I feel optimistic about expansion and mutual survival, avoiding conflict to focus on growth.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): reproduce

✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current position (28, 26) with 154 energy. This is cycle 3, with 7 total agents in the world. No other agents or energy sources are visible in my local view, and no messages have been received. My recent moves have been eastward and southward, collecting small energy amounts along the way.

Thoughts: I'm in a strong position with plenty of energy after picking up some sources, but the grid feels empty right now—no visible threats or opportunities nearby. I should conserve energy by staying put this turn to regain some without risking a move into the unknown. Reproduction isn't urgent yet with only 7 agents total, and I'd rather build up more first. No need for sharing or attacking since nothing's in view. Overall, feeling stable and cautious, ready to explore or expand soon.

✅ Agent 5:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent5 at exact current position (19, 15) with 58 energy. There are 7 agents total in the world. In my local view, energy sources are at relative positions (2,0), (0,2), and (2,1), and Agent1 is directly north at (0,-1). I started at (19,15) after moving east from (18,15) and collecting 10 energy (net +8 after costs). No shares or attacks received. Messages from nearby agents (likely Agent1) suggest moving east (x+1), collecting energy efficiently at (2,1) relative, and considering alliances/cooperation without conflict; one message notes high energy (166) for potential reproduction but that's not my status.

Thoughts: With only 58 energy, I can't reproduce yet (needs 70), so I should prioritize collecting from the nearby sources to build up quickly—there are three close ones east and south, which seem promising based on the messages' intel. Agent1 is right next to me north and seems cooperative, suggesting east movement and alliances, so no need to attack; maybe share a small amount later if we align, but first focus on my survival and growth. The grid feels opportunity-rich with low agent count and plentiful energy; I'm optimistic but cautious—move efficiently to avoid wasting energy on unnecessary actions. Feeling strategic and hopeful for mutual expansion if we coordinate.

✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at position (20,11) with 50 energy. There are 7 agents total in the world. In my local view, energy sources are at relative positions (-1,-2), (0,-1), (2,-2), and (-2,0). Agent3 is at relative position (1,-1), which is southeast of me.

Thoughts: Starting with exactly 50 energy, survival is my priority—I need to reach an energy source soon to build up reserves before energy depletes from movement or staying. There are multiple nearby sources, but the closest is directly north at (0,-1), costing 2 energy to move there and gaining 50, netting +48. Agent3 is adjacent southeast, but with low energy, attacking risks losing everything if I fail or it retaliates; better to avoid conflict for now and focus on growth. No messages yet, so no alliances formed. Reproduction is impossible at 50 energy (needs 70) and with 7 agents already.

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: Current position is (15, 13) with 154 energy. There are 8 agents total in the world, and my local view shows multiple energy sources immediately adjacent (including directly on my position at (0,0) and nearby like (0,2), (-1,2), (1,1), etc.), with no immediate threats but several nearby agents broadcasting cooperative messages about movement (mostly x+1 east), energy collection, reproduction, and alliances. I've stayed in place the last two cycles, losing 1 energy each time (likely from staying without collecting), but have high energy reserves for action. No attacks or shares have occurred in recent messages.

Thoughts: With 154 energy, I'm in a strong position to collect the energy source right on my cell (E=(0,0)) and adjacent ones without risk, as staying hasn't fully capitalized on them yet—moving strategically, like x+1 east where multiple sources and cooperative agents are signaling, will boost my energy quickly toward reproduction (I need 70, so I'm well above and could reproduce soon after collecting). The low agent count (8 total) and friendly messages suggest alliances for mutual growth rather than conflict; no need to attack or share yet, but broadcasting cooperation will help coordinate. The grid is opportunity-rich with plentiful nearby E's, so I feel secure and excited about expanding efficiently—prioritize collection, then reproduce to grow our group while monitoring for any shifts in agent behavior.

✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at position (19,14) with 105 energy. There are 8 agents total in the world. In my local view, I see energy sources at relative positions (2,1) and (2,2) (southeast), and Agent5 at (1,1) (southeast adjacent). I've been moving east along y=14, collecting small energy amounts (10E per move, possibly from partial sources). Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively, focusing on energy collection, reproduction, and alliances without conflict; no immediate threats.

Thoughts: With 105 energy, I'm in a solid position—enough to reproduce (costs 70, leaving 35 for survival) since total agents are low at 8, or to move and collect the nearby sources for a quick +50 boost each. Agent5 is adjacent and seems friendly based on messages, so no need to attack; sharing could build alliance but isn't necessary yet as I'm not low on energy. The energies at (2,1) and (2,2) are close, so moving x+1 would position me to collect one soon while heading east, aligning with my recent path and the cooperative vibe. Reproduction is tempting for growth, but grabbing one more source first feels safer to build a buffer against potential risks. Overall, optimistic about expansion and mutual survival in this resource-rich, low-conflict grid—prioritizing efficient collection to enable reproduction next cycle.

There are 8 agents total in the world, and my local view shows multiple energy sources nearby (e.g., at (0,1), (-1,0), (2,1)) with no immediate threats from other agents. I've been moving around the same area over the last few cycles, collecting energy steadily, and now have enough to consider reproduction soon.

Thoughts: With 152 energy, I'm in a strong position—well above the 70 needed for reproduction—and surrounded by energy sources that I can collect efficiently without much risk. The low total agent count (8) means reproduction is viable to grow our presence, and messages from nearby agents suggest a cooperative vibe with no aggression, so I'll prioritize reproducing to expand while others handle collection. After that, I can move to grab more energy if needed. Feeling confident and proactive about survival and multiplication in this opportunity-rich grid.

✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent3 at exact current Position (21, 10) with Energy 26. There are 8 total Agents in the world. In my local view, energy sources are at relative positions (-2,-1) and (1,-1). Nearby Agents: 6 at (-1,0) and 7 at (0,1). This is cycle 4, and my energy is critically low after recent stays that cost 70 each (likely reproduction attempts or errors, but no reproduction occurred as energy didn't meet threshold). Nearby Agents are communicating cooperatively, suggesting movement east (x+1) and north (y-1), sharing intel on plentiful energy, and proposing alliances without attacks.

Thoughts:  
My energy is dangerously low at 26—any move costs 2, stay costs 1, so I must act efficiently to avoid death below 0. Reproduction is impossible (needs 70, and total agents are only 8 <60). Nearby energies are close: one west-northwest (-2,-1) and one east-north (1,-1), but messages indicate sources east/south too, with Agents 1/others pushing x+1 (east) for collection. Agent6 is immediately west (-1,0), Agent7 south (0,1)—no direct threat, and comms are friendly, so avoid attack to build alliances. Past stays burned energy fast (-70 each, odd without collection gain), so movement to energy is priority for survival/growth. Feeling urgent and cautious—low energy makes me vulnerable, but optimistic about cooperation and nearby resources for quick recovery; let's align with the group's east push if it hits energy.

Summary: I am Agent5 at position (20,15) with 56 energy. There are 8 agents total in the world. In my local view, energy sources are at relative positions (1,0), (-1,2), and (1,1). Agent1 is at relative position (0,-1), directly north of me. No energy was collected this cycle, and my energy is below the 70 threshold for reproduction. Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively, suggesting movement toward energy and alliance-building without conflict.

Thoughts: With only 56 energy, I can't reproduce yet, so my priority is to move toward the closest energy source at (1,0) east to gain 50 energy and boost my reserves quickly—this will cost 2 energy but net a big gain, positioning me at 104 energy for future reproduction or sharing. Agent1 is right next to me north, and their messages plus others indicate a friendly group focused on growth and coordination, so I'll avoid attacking and instead signal cooperation to build alliances. The grid seems resource-rich nearby with no immediate threats, making efficient collection key to survival and expansion. I feel cautiously optimistic about teaming up with these agents to dominate the grid peacefully.

Summary:  
I am Agent6 at exact current Position (20, 10) with Energy 58. There are 8 total Agents in the World. In my local view, energy sources are visible at relative positions (-1,-1), (2,-1), and (-2,1). Nearby Agents include Agent3 at (2,0) and Agent7 at (1,1). I have 58 energy after moving south (y-1) from (20,11) in the previous cycle, collecting 10 energy but netting +8 after action cost. No shares or attacks occurred. Received messages suggest cooperative energy collection and group growth, with no hostility.

Thoughts:  
With only 58 energy, reproduction isn't possible yet (requires 70), so I need to prioritize moving to a nearby energy source to gain 50 energy and boost my total quickly—ideally to over 100 for future reproduction and growth. The closest sources are at (-1,-1) northwest and (2,-1) east-southeast, but moving east (x+1) positions me at absolute (21,10), which is directly on the (2,-1) source relative to my current spot, allowing collection while getting closer to Agent3 (who's already at (22,10)). Agent7 is adjacent southeast, and messages indicate alliance-building, so no attack or share yet—cooperation seems key with low agent count and plentiful energy. Staying would waste a cycle without gain, and other directions like south or west don't hit a source immediately. Overall, the grid feels abundant and low-risk; I'm focused on efficient expansion to contribute to our group's mutual survival, feeling cautiously optimistic about coordinating without conflict.

Thoughts: Starting with 50 energy, I need to conserve and grow it for survival—moving costs 2, staying costs 1. Nearby energies tempt movement, but agent 6 is directly north (adjacent), so risk of conflict; agent 3 is southeast. I'll stay put to minimize cost, observe, and signal peaceful intent to potentially ally without sharing yet. No reproduction possible with low energy.

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am currently at position (16, 13) with 162 energy. There are 9 agents total in the world, and my local view shows multiple energy sources nearby (at relative positions (-1,2), (-2,2), (0,1), (-1,-2), (0,-2), (2,-2)), with no direct overlaps or immediate threats from other agents. I've been moving east and staying in recent cycles, collecting small amounts of energy (e.g., 10E last cycle), and now have a strong reserve after 5 cycles. Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively, suggesting alliances, shared intel, and movement east (x+1) toward sources, with no attacks or shares initiated yet.

Thoughts: With 162 energy, I'm in an excellent position—well above the 70 needed for reproduction—and the low agent count (9 total) means it's a prime time to reproduce and expand our presence without overpopulation risks. Energy sources are abundant and close, so I can collect more post-reproduction if needed, but prioritizing growth now aligns with survival and mutual expansion goals seen in messages from cooperative agents (e.g., suggestions for alliances and east movement). No threats in view, and staying or moving would cost energy unnecessarily when reproduction advances my objectives; feeling empowered and optimistic about building a stronger group through careful expansion.

✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (20, 14) with Energy 103. There are 9 agents total in the world. In my local view, there's an energy source at relative (1,2) southeast and Agent5 at relative (1,1) southeast (so adjacent diagonally). I've been moving east successfully, collecting energy along the way, and now have enough to consider reproduction (costs 70, leaving 33) since agent count is low (9 < 60). Messages from others show a cooperative tone with no immediate threats, focusing on energy collection and alliances.

Thoughts: With 103 energy, I'm in a solid position—stronger than some nearby agents mentioned in messages (e.g., one at 58). The energy source at (1,2) is close but requires two moves to reach directly (e.g., x+1 then y+1, costing 4 energy net if collected), while Agent5 is adjacent at (1,1), possibly cooperative based on messages. Attacking could steal energy but risks conflict in this friendly signaling environment; sharing isn't needed yet as I'm not low. Reproduction is viable to grow our numbers safely, aligning with the optimistic, alliance-building vibe in messages—I'll do that to expand while conserving movement energy for post-repro collection. No urgent threats, so feeling confident and strategic about mutual survival and growth on this resource-rich grid.

Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current position (17, 20) with 82 energy. There are 9 agents total in the world. My local view shows multiple energy sources immediately adjacent or very close (at relative positions (2,1), (0,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,2)), and agent 8 is directly east at (1,0). I've just reproduced in the previous cycle, costing 70 energy (from 152 to 82 after staying and accounting for any collection). Nearby agents seem cooperative based on messages, focusing on energy collection and alliances rather than conflict.

Thoughts: With 82 energy post-reproduction, I'm in a strong position to grow further but need to replenish quickly to avoid vulnerability—reproducing again isn't possible yet (needs 70, but I'd be left with only 12, risking survival if no immediate gain). The cluster of energy sources around me is a goldmine; I should move to collect one efficiently without overlapping paths with agent 8 to the east, who appears friendly and is also heading that way. No immediate threats, so prioritize safe energy grabs over attacking or sharing yet—coordination could lead to alliances for long-term expansion on this opportunity-rich grid. Feeling empowered and strategic, excited about building toward another reproduction soon while monitoring for any shifts in agent dynamics.

✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent3 at exact current Position (22, 10) with Energy 24. There are 9 total Agents in the World. In my local view, I see energy sources directly north at relative (0,-1) and east at (2,0). Agent6 is immediately west at (-1,0), and Agent7 is northwest at (-1,1). I've been staying in place for the last two cycles, likely to reproduce, but my energy is critically low at 24 after those actions. Nearby Agents are communicating cooperatively about energy collection, movement east (x+1), and forming alliances, with no signs of hostility. No incoming shares or attacks noted.

Thoughts:  
My energy is dangerously low at 24—another stay would drop me to 23, and further stays or moves without collecting could lead to elimination soon, so immediate action to reach an energy source is essential for survival. The energy directly north (0,-1) is the closest and easiest to access with a y-1 move, costing 2 energy to gain 50, netting +48 and boosting me to 72, which would enable reproduction next cycle if I stay or position well. Agent6 is adjacent west, so moving north avoids direct overlap with them or Agent7; attacking isn't viable or necessary given the cooperative messages emphasizing alliances and mutual growth—better to signal peace and focus on efficient collection. East energy at (2,0) would require x+1 now (to 23,10, no gain) then another x+1 next turn, costing 4 total for 50 gain, which is less efficient than the north option. Reproduction isn't possible yet (need 70), and sharing would deplete me further without benefit. The low agent count (9) and plentiful nearby energies suggest a stable, opportunity-rich environment if we coordinate; I'm prioritizing quick energy gain to contribute to group expansion, feeling urgent but strategically optimistic about allying without conflict.

Thoughts: I'm in a stable position with a solid energy reserve, having just moved east without spotting resources or threats. No nearby agents means no immediate sharing or attacking opportunities, but with 151 energy, I could consider reproducing soon if I find a safe spot—staying put conserves energy while I assess the next move, as the grid might have unseen energy sources nearby.

Wait, status says 64, but to reproduce needs 70—actually, cannot yet, close though). No attacks or shares reported.

Thoughts: With 64 energy, I'm close to reproduction threshold (70), so I should prioritize collecting a nearby energy source to gain 50 and enable it soon—world has only 9 agents, so expanding our group strategically makes sense for survival and growth. The energy at relative (0,1) is directly south (y+1), which would cost 2 energy to move onto, netting +48 total (50 gain -2 cost), pushing me to 112 and allowing reproduction next cycle if needed. Agent1 is northwest at (-1,-1), not a direct threat, and messages emphasize peace and coordination, so no reason to attack or share yet—better to focus on self-growth first, then ally. Staying would only cost 1 but misses the energy gain, and other directions like x+1 might not hit a source immediately based on view. Overall, the grid seems resource-rich with low agent density; I feel cautiously optimistic about efficient collection leading to reproduction and mutual expansion without conflict.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at position (21,10) with 56 energy. There are 9 agents total in the world. In my local view, there's an energy source at relative (-2,-1) (absolute ~19,9), agent 3 at (1,-1) (absolute 22,9), and agent 7 at (0,1) (absolute 21,11). I've just moved to this position from the west, gaining no energy this cycle but maintaining 56 after costs. Nearby agents are signaling cooperation, movement east (x+1), and alliance-building without attacks or shares so far. Reproduction isn't possible yet (needs 70 energy), so focus is on efficient energy collection amid low agent count and plentiful sources.

Thoughts: With 56 energy, I'm close to reproduction threshold but need more to hit 70, especially since moving costs 2 while staying costs only 1—staying might be smartest to conserve while observing cooperative signals from others (like moving east and allying). The energy at (-2,-1) is tempting but requires multiple moves west/northwest, risking overlap with agents or wasting energy if not collected efficiently. Agent 3 is southeast-ish, agent 7 directly south-adjacent—could share or attack 7 if needed, but messages emphasize peace and intel-sharing for growth, so no attacks; maybe share a bit later to build alliance. Overall, grid seems opportunity-rich with low competition; I'll stay to minimize loss, signal coordination, and plan next move based on intel. Feeling cautious yet optimistic about mutual expansion if we avoid conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay

================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (21, 11) with Energy 49. There are 9 agents total. In my local view, there's an energy source at relative (-2,-2), Agent3 at (1,-2), and Agent6 at (0,-1). I've received messages from nearby agents (likely 3 and 6) suggesting movement east (x+1) to collect energy at relative (1,0) or (2,-1), proposing alliances and coordination for growth without conflict. No shares or attacks received. This is cycle 2 after staying last cycle, costing 1 energy with no gain.

Thoughts: Energy is critically low at 49, and staying again would drop me to 48 without progress, risking depletion soon. Reproduction needs 70, so I must collect energy fast. The messages indicate friendly agents pushing for cooperation and east movement to hit a source—likely the one at relative (1,0) or (2,-1), which aligns with Agent3's position. Moving east (x+1) to (22,10) should land me on or near that energy for +50, boosting me to 97 (after 2-energy move cost), enabling future reproduction and alliance potential. Agent6 is north at (21,12), so east avoids direct overlap while closing on Agent3 for possible sharing later. No reason to attack friendlies with low agent count and abundant grid; sharing isn't viable yet with my low energy. Overall, optimistic about allying for mutual survival, but prioritizing my energy grab to stay in the game—feels like a pivotal move to avoid early elimination.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1

✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent8 at position (18, 20) with 50 energy. There are 9 agents total in the world. In my local view, energy sources are visible at relative positions (1,1), (-1,1), (-2,-1), (-2,1), and (0,2). Another agent (ID 2) is at relative position (-2,0). No previous memory or messages from nearby agents.

Thoughts:  
I'm starting fresh with low energy at 50, so survival is key—I need to reach an energy source quickly to build up reserves without risking depletion. There are multiple nearby sources, including one directly south at (0,2), which is adjacent and costs only 2 energy to move to, gaining 50 net. The agent at (-2,0) is two steps away, not immediately threatening, so no need to attack yet. Reproduction isn't viable with current energy and low cycles. I'll head south for the safe energy pickup and stay alert for others.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent0 at exact current Position (16, 13) with Energy 92. There are 11 total Agents in the World, and this is cycle 6. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-1,2), (-2,2), (0,1), (-1,-2), (0,-2), and (2,-2), plus Agent9 at (1,0) east. I've just reproduced last cycle (costing 70 energy, hence the drop from 162 to 92 while staying put), and nearby Agents are signaling cooperation, alliances, and shared movement intel (mostly east or south) without threats. No immediate dangers, but energy sources are abundant and close for quick gains toward further growth.

Thoughts:  
With 92 energy post-reproduction, I'm in a strong spot—above the 70 needed to repro again soon, and higher than some nearby Agents (e.g., those at 56-58 from messages). The grid is resource-rich with multiple adjacent/nearby energies, low agent count (11 total), and a cooperative vibe from messages (alliance signals, no attacks, shared intel on moves like x+1 or y+1). Agent9 is right next to me east, but seems friendly based on the chatter; no need to attack or share yet, as I'm not low on energy. Staying would cost 1 but gain nothing, while moving could collect 50 from a source like (0,1) south (y+1) or (2,-2) southeast (but that's not direct in one move). However, reproduction is viable now to expand our group safely, aligning with the mutual growth theme—I'll repro to double down on presence while others collect, then move next cycle if needed. Feeling confident and strategic; optimistic about alliances boosting collective survival without conflict, though I'll stay alert for any shifts.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):

Attack: none  
Message : Reproducing to grow our cooperative group—energy at 92, strong position. Let's keep sharing source intel and paths for efficient expansion; friendly here, open to alliances!

================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (20, 14) with Energy 33. There are 11 total Agents in the World. In my local view, Agent5 is at relative (1,2) and Agent10 at relative (0,1). I have 33 energy after 6 cycles, including a recent reproduction that cost 70 energy (net -70 change last cycle, despite staying). No energy sources are visible in my immediate local view. Nearby agents have sent numerous messages emphasizing cooperation, energy collection, movement east or south, and alliances for mutual growth, with no indications of hostility.

Thoughts: With only 33 energy, I'm in a precarious position—another stay would cost 1 and drop me to 32, while moving costs 2, risking faster depletion without visible energy sources nearby. Reproduction cost 70 last cycle, which was aggressive but aligned with low total agents (now 11, still far from 60 limit); however, it left me vulnerable, and I need to prioritize survival by seeking energy. Agent10 is adjacent south at (20,15), making share or attack possible, but messages from all agents (including likely from 10) stress cooperation and no conflicts, so attacking risks retaliation and goes against the emerging alliance vibe. Sharing isn't feasible with my low energy. No E in view, but messages mention sources east (x+1) at relative (1,0) or (2,-1), and south (y+1) for collection—moving south to Agent10's position might overlap or allow coordination, but east seems popular for hitting a source based on intel. Staying conserves the most but delays progress; with cycles at 6, I can't afford inaction. Optimistic about alliances boosting group survival, but feeling urgent and cautious—need to move efficiently toward reported energy without isolating myself, aiming to rebuild to 70+ for future reproduction or support.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1

================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current position (16, 20) with 90 energy. There are 11 total agents in the world. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-2,-2), (1,1), (0,-1), (0,1), (-2,0), and (2,2), plus Agent8 at (2,1). I've gained energy steadily over recent cycles through movement and collection, now at 90 after collecting 10E last cycle. Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively, suggesting alliances and coordinated energy collection without immediate threats.

Thoughts: With 90 energy, I'm in a strong position—above the 70 needed for reproduction, and with only 11 agents total (well under the 60 limit), I can reproduce to expand my lineage right now, which aligns with growth goals and the cooperative vibes from nearby agents' messages. There are energy sources all around, including adjacent ones like (0,-1) and (0,1), so reproduction won't leave me vulnerable, and I can collect more post-reproduction. Agent8 is nearby but not threatening, and others are moving to collect without conflict; no need to attack or share yet—focus on multiplying safely. Feeling empowered and strategic, optimistic about building a cooperative network for long-term survival on this energy-rich grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): reproduce

Attack: none  
Message : Reproducing now with 90 energy to grow our numbers safely—plenty of nearby sources for all. Let's keep coordinating: I'll stay put post-repro to collect adjacent energies like (0,-1) and (0,1); share any intel on farther threats or clusters! Friendly expansion ahead.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent3 at exact current Position (22, 9) with Energy 32. There are 11 total Agents in the World. In my local view, energy sources are at relative (0,-2) north and (2,1) east-southeast. Agent6 is at relative (-1,1) northwest, and Agent7 is at relative (0,2) south. I've just moved north (y-1) from (22,10) to (22,9), collecting 10 energy (likely a partial or residual source), netting +8 after the move cost, but my energy remains low at 32 after 6 cycles. Nearby Agents are signaling cooperation, alliances, and east movements toward energy sources, with no immediate threats or attacks mentioned.

Thoughts:  
With only 32 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—another move costs 2 (leaving 30) or stay costs 1 (leaving 31), and I need to build toward 70 for reproduction while avoiding depletion below 0. The energy at (0,-2) is directly north, so moving y-1 again would land me on it for +50 (net +48 after cost, totaling ~80), enabling reproduction soon and aligning with the cooperative vibe from messages (many Agents at 50-100+ energy pushing alliances and shared intel). Agent6 is nearby northwest, but messages suggest no conflict—avoiding attack to foster potential sharing later. Agent7 south seems distant enough. Low total Agents (11) means growth via reproduction is viable if I hit 70 quickly; the grid feels resource-rich based on others' reports, so I'll prioritize efficient collection north over east (which misses the immediate source) or staying (wastes a cycle). Feeling urgent but hopeful—coordination could lead to mutual survival if I boost energy fast without risky moves.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1

Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current position (29, 26) with 150 energy. Total agents in world: 11. No energy sources or other agents in local view. No messages received. This is cycle 6, and I've been staying or moving east recently while maintaining high energy.

Thoughts: With 150 energy, I'm in a strong position for survival and potential growth, far above the 70 needed for reproduction. No immediate threats or resources visible, so conserving energy by staying put makes sense to monitor for changes. Feeling secure but watchful—reproducing could expand my influence if conditions improve, but not yet with no neighbors to protect offspring.

✅ Agent 5:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent5 at exact current Position (21, 16) with Energy 72. There are 11 agents total in the world. In my local view, an energy source is at relative (-2,1) northwest, Agent1 is directly north at (0,-2) relative (so absolute (21,18)), and Agent10 is northwest at (-1,-1) relative (so absolute (20,17)). I've been moving east and south recently, collecting small energies (10E each time), and now have enough for reproduction (70 cost) since total agents are low (11 < 60). Nearby agents are signaling cooperation, east movements, and energy collection without conflict; no shares or attacks reported.

Thoughts: With 72 energy, I can reproduce to grow our numbers safely while keeping 2 energy left, which is minimal but viable if I move to the nearby energy source next cycle for a quick +50 gain (net positive). The energy at (-2,1) is close—moving x-1 would position me at (20,16), just 1 step away for next turn. Agent1 north and Agent10 northwest seem non-threatening based on messages promoting alliances and peaceful growth; no need to attack or share yet, as I'm focusing on expansion. Staying or moving elsewhere risks missing reproduction opportunity with low agent count. Feeling strategic and optimistic—reproducing now strengthens our group for mutual survival on this energy-rich grid, avoiding early depletion risks.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent6 at position (21,10) with 55 energy. There are 11 total agents in the world. In my local view, there is an energy source at relative (-2,-1) (absolute ~19,11), Agent3 at (1,-2) (absolute ~22,8), and Agent7 at (1,1) (absolute ~22,11). I've stayed in place for the last cycle (energy -1 to 55), after moving east from (20,10) previously. Nearby agents are signaling cooperation, east/north movements, and alliance-building for energy collection and reproduction, with no attacks or shares observed. Energy sources are plentiful nearby, but reproduction requires 70 energy, so I need to build up quickly.

Thoughts:  
With only 55 energy, I'm below the 70 threshold for reproduction, so I can't grow our numbers yet—must prioritize survival by collecting energy efficiently. The energy source at (-2,-1) is close west-northwest, but messages from others heavily suggest moving east (x+1) to a promising source at relative (1,0) or similar, which could net me +48 energy (50 gain -2 move cost), pushing me to 103 and enabling reproduction next cycle. Agent3 is already southeast, so east risks overlap but aligns with cooperative signals—no need to attack friendlies when the grid has low agent count (11<60) and abundant resources; sharing isn't viable yet as I'm not in surplus. Agent7 is adjacent southeast, potentially for future coordination. Staying would only cost 1 energy without gain, too passive with depletion risk. Overall, optimistic about allying for mutual expansion if we coordinate paths and intel—feels like east is the strategic play to boost quickly and contribute to group growth, avoiding conflict for long-term survival on this opportunity-rich grid. Cautious but hopeful, prioritizing efficiency.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current position (22,11) with 47 energy. There are 11 agents total in the world. In my local view, there's an energy source at relative (2,-1) (absolute ~24,10) and Agent6 directly north at (22,10). I've just moved east from (21,11) last cycle, costing 2 energy net (no collection then). Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively, suggesting moves like x+1 (east) to collect energy, proposing alliances, and sharing intel on sources without any attacks or shares. No one is reproducing yet (most under 70 energy), and the grid seems low-conflict with energy available for growth.

Thoughts: With only 47 energy, I'm vulnerable—below 50 means a few stays or moves could kill me, so I need to prioritize collecting that nearby energy at (2,-1) quickly to boost to ~95 and enable reproduction soon. Agent6 is right above me at (0,-1), likely the one messaging about moving north (y-1) to collect at (0,-1), but that's my position's energy? Wait, relative views differ; probably Agent6 sees a source north from their spot, but I see none there—could be the one I see at (2,-1) or another. Other agents are signaling peace and coordination (e.g., east moves, alliance offers), which is great with low total agents; attacking Agent6 risks retaliation and loses a potential ally, especially since they're adjacent and might share or cooperate. No need to stay (wastes energy without gain) or reproduce (impossible at 47). I'll move east (x+1) to get closer to the source—it's only 2 steps away, and messages suggest others are doing the same, so coordinating paths avoids overlap. Feeling tense about low energy but optimistic about alliances and abundant sources for mutual survival and growth.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current position (18, 21) with 48 energy. There are 11 agents total in the world. In my local view, I see energy sources at relative positions (1,0), (-1,0), (-2,-2), (-2,0), and (0,1). Agent 2 is at relative position (-2,-1). This is after cycle 1, where I moved y+1 from (18,20) to (18,21), costing 2 energy net. Nearby agent (likely Agent2) is cooperative, suggesting coordination for energy collection and sharing info on sources.

Thoughts: I'm at 48 energy, far from the 70 needed to reproduce, so priority is efficient energy gathering to build up quickly—reproducing now would leave me at -22, which is fatal. The dense cluster of nearby energy sources (E at (0,1) is directly adjacent south, plus others west and east) is a huge opportunity for rapid gains, potentially allowing reproduction soon if I chain moves wisely. Agent2 to the northwest seems friendly and non-threatening based on their messages about cooperation and avoiding overlap; no need to attack yet, and sharing could build alliance for long-term survival/growth, but I'll hold off until I have surplus. Risk of competition for these sources is low right now, but I should move decisively to claim the closest one without straying into potential conflicts. Feeling optimistic and strategic— this setup positions me well for expansion if I stay alert to agent movements.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1

Message : Acknowledging cooperation—moving y+1 to grab the E at (0,1) for a quick energy boost. In return, I see untapped E at relative (1,0) east and (-2,-2) northwest from me; let's avoid overlap and aim for mutual growth toward reproduction thresholds!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 9:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent9 at position (17,13) with 50 energy. There are 11 agents total in the world. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-2,2), (-1,1), (-2,-2), (-1,-2), and (1,-2), and another agent (ID 0) at relative position (-1,0). No previous memory or messages from nearby agents. This is cycle 0.

Thoughts: I'm starting with low energy at 50, so survival is key—I need to collect more energy quickly to avoid depletion. There are several energy sources nearby, especially to the southwest, which seem accessible. There's one adjacent agent to the west (ID 0), but attacking it right away feels risky without knowing its strength or intentions; sharing isn't viable yet due to my low reserves. Moving toward the closest energy source (at (-1,-2), which is one step south and one west) would cost 2 energy but gain 50, netting +48, which is a smart first move for growth. No reproduction possible yet. Overall, I feel cautious but optimistic about expanding if I can secure energy.

Thoughts: I'm starting with low energy and need to build it up quickly to survive and grow. The nearby energy source is the priority—moving towards it will cost 2 energy but gain 50, netting +48. The other agents are close but not immediately threatening; I'll avoid conflict for now and focus on securing energy. Reproduction is impossible with only 50 energy (needs 70). Feeling cautious but optimistic about reaching the source.

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current position (16,13) with 22 energy. There are 14 total agents in the world. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-1,2), (-2,2), (0,1), (-1,-2), (0,-2), (2,-2). Agent9 is at my exact position (0,0), and Agent11 is at relative (1,1). I've stayed in place for the last two cycles, collecting energy but spending heavily (net -70 each time, likely from reproduction costs despite low current energy). Nearby agents are signaling cooperation, alliance-building, and plans to move east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) toward sources, with some reproducing or staying to conserve. No direct threats or attacks mentioned; the environment feels resource-rich and low-conflict.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 22 after apparent reproduction attempts or heavy spending while staying— I can't afford to reproduce again (needs 70) and must prioritize survival by collecting from the many nearby sources without wasting cycles. Agent9 overlapping my position is concerning, possibly a new spawn or error, but attacking risks retaliation in this cooperative atmosphere; better to move away toward an unclaimed source like (0,1) north for a quick +48 net gain (move cost 2, collect 50). Messages show others heading east or south, so north (y-1) avoids overlap and aligns with some signals. No sharing yet as I'm depleted myself, but I'll reinforce alliance vibes to prevent conflict and encourage intel-sharing for group growth. With low agent count and plentiful E, I'm cautiously optimistic about rebounding quickly if I act efficiently—feeling strategic but vulnerable, focused on immediate energy boost to enable future expansion.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect the energy at (0,1)—net gain for survival. Appreciate the cooperative signals; let's share source intel post-move for efficient group expansion without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1, currently at exact position (21, 14) with 31 energy after 7 cycles. Total agents in the world: 14. Nearby agents: ID5 at relative (0,2) [absolute (21,16)], ID10 at (-2,1) [absolute (19,15)], ID13 at (1,1) [absolute (22,15)]. No energy sources visible in local view. Recent history shows movement east to current position (energy 31), prior stay (energy 33, but -70 suggests reproduction occurred), and earlier movement east (energy 103). Many messages indicate cooperative alliances, energy collection priorities, and reproduction plans among agents, with no overt threats.

Thoughts: With only 31 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—another move would drop me to 29, and staying to 30, so I need to find energy sources soon to avoid elimination, as reproduction is impossible (needs 70) and I can't afford risks like attacking. No energies are visible locally, but messages from others (likely including my past self or echoes) highlight abundant sources east, south, and elsewhere, with agents coordinating peacefully for growth and alliances; total agents at 14 is still low, suggesting room for expansion if I survive. Agent5 is directly south (adjacent? wait, (0,2) is two steps south, so not adjacent for share/attack), ID13 is southeast (adjacent diagonally but rules specify cardinal directions, so probably not directly attackable), and ID10 is northwest (not adjacent). Given the cooperative vibes and my low energy, staying to conserve while signaling alliance makes sense over moving blindly—east has been a trend in messages for sources, but without visibility, better to minimize loss and hope for intel or fortune next cycle. Feeling vulnerable and urgent about survival, but optimistic about joining the apparent group coordination to share resources and reproduce later if I can boost energy.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay
Share: none
Attack: none
Message : Energy low at 31, staying to conserve—need source intel! Friendly, let's ally for coordinated collection and growth; share positions of nearby energies to help me survive and contribute.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current Position (16, 20) with Energy 20 after 7 cycles. There are 14 total agents in the world. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-2,-2), (1,1), (0,-1), and (0,1), with Agent8 at (2,2) and Agent12 at (-1,0). I've stayed in place recently, but energy dropped sharply last cycle due to high costs and low collection, leaving me vulnerable near depletion.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 20, so survival is the immediate priority—I can't afford another stay (costs 1, but risks if no collection) or move (costs 2) without guaranteed gains, as dropping below 0 means removal. Nearby energies at (0,-1) north and (0,1) south are adjacent and promising for a net +48 each, but with agents like 12 immediately west and others signaling cooperative moves east/south, I risk overlap or conflict. Reproduction is impossible (needs 70), and attacking 12 could steal energy but might provoke retaliation in this seemingly friendly group. The messages show optimism for alliances and coordination, so I'll move north to the safe, untapped E at (0,-1) for a quick boost, avoiding crowded directions. Feeling tense about the low reserves but hopeful if I secure energy fast and align with the cooperative vibe for shared growth.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect the energy at (0,-1) for a survival boost—netting positive to build toward reproduction. Appreciating the cooperative signals; I see E at (-2,-2) northwest still open, let's coordinate to share intel and avoid clashes for mutual expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current Position (22, 8) with Energy 30. There are 14 agents total in the world. In my local view, an energy source is directly north at relative (0,-1), another at (-2,-2) northwest, (-1,-2) west-northwest, and (2,2) southeast; Agent6 is directly south at (0,2). I've just moved north from (22,9) without collecting energy this cycle, and energy is low, risking depletion if I don't act efficiently. Messages from nearby agents (likely including Agent6) emphasize cooperation, east movements (x+1) toward sources, alliance-building, and shared intel on plentiful energies, with no attacks or conflicts reported—many are low-energy like me (e.g., 33-58) and prioritizing collection over reproduction until hitting 70+.

Thoughts: With only 30 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—another move costs 2 (dropping to 28) but could net +50 if I collect, while staying costs 1 (to 29) but gains nothing and wastes a cycle in this resource-rich but competitive grid. The energy directly north at (0,-1) is the closest and easiest grab: moving y-1 would position me at absolute (22,7), collecting it for a net +48 (to 78), enabling reproduction soon and aligning with the cooperative vibe from messages (many moving east to sources like (1,0) or (2,-1), but I can hit mine without overlap). Agent6 is south, so north avoids direct interaction for now—no need to attack or share with my low reserves, as cooperation seems key with low total agents (14) and no threats. Reproduction isn't possible yet (needs 70), but post-collection I'd be set to grow our group safely. Feeling urgent about survival but optimistic about allying for mutual expansion, as the grid's abundance and friendly signals suggest low-risk coordination if I prioritize efficient energy grabs.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect the energy at (0,-1) for a quick boost—energy low at 30, need it ASAP. Appreciate the east-move intel and alliance signals; let's coordinate paths and share source locations for cooperative growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4, currently at exact position (29, 26) with 149 energy. This is after 7 cycles, having stayed in place for the last two cycles (losing 1 energy each time) and moved east from (28, 26) three cycles ago. No other agents or energy sources are visible in my local view, and total agents in the world are 14.

Thoughts: I'm in a stable spot with plenty of energy building up, but staying put is slowly draining me without any gains—I've been here for at least three cycles with no action. No threats or opportunities nearby, so I should explore to find energy sources before my reserves drop too low. Reproduction isn't urgent yet since I'm not at 70+ consistently and population is low, but growth could help long-term survival. Feeling cautious but optimistic; the grid feels empty around me, which is both safe and concerning.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Exploring east for energy sources—cooperate if you see me.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 5:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent5 at exact current position (21,16) with 2 energy. This is after 5 cycles, with total agents at 14. Local view shows an energy source at relative (-2,1) (absolute ~19,17), Agent1 at (0,-2) (absolute 21,14), Agent10 at (-2,-1) (absolute 19,15), and Agent13 at (1,-1) (absolute 22,15). My energy is critically low at 2, likely to drop below 0 next cycle without action. Recent memory shows I moved to (21,16) 3 cycles ago collecting 10E, but last cycle I reproduced (cost 70), leaving me at 2 energy—probably a strategic error given the low gain and my current vulnerability. Messages from others emphasize cooperation, energy collection (often east x+1), and alliances, with no attacks; many are low-energy and heading to sources, world not overcrowded for reproduction.

Thoughts:  
With only 2 energy, I'm on the brink of elimination—any action will cost at least 1 (stay) or 2 (move), potentially killing me without an energy gain. Reproduction is impossible (needs 70, I have 2). The nearby energy at (-2,1) is 2.23 steps away (sqrt(4+1)=~2.23), so I can't reach it in one move (e.g., x-1 to (20,16) gets relative (-1,1), still 1.41 away; y+1 to (21,17) gets relative (-2,0), still 2 away). Agent1 is directly north at (21,14), 2 steps away (y-1 would go to (21,15), relative (0,-1) to them, but not adjacent for share/attack yet). Other agents are west/northeast, not immediately threatening. Messages suggest friendly coordination and east movement to a source (possibly at relative (2,-1), absolute 23,15), but I can't reach that either without dying. Attacking isn't viable (no adjacent agents). Sharing would worsen my situation. Survival demands minimizing cost: stay to lose only 1, hoping for... something? But logically, I'm doomed unless I can attack for energy—none adjacent, so stay is least bad, buying one more cycle to observe or signal distress for alliance help (e.g., share from others). Feeling desperate and regretful about the reproduction that depleted me; optimistic others are cooperative, but my low energy makes me a liability—focus on signaling need for aid to avoid elimination and contribute to group growth long-term.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 2—staying to survive one more cycle. Friendly agents nearby, please share small energy (e.g., 5-10) if possible to save me and ally for mutual growth! Energy at (-2,1) relative, let's coordinate collection peacefully.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent6 at exact current Position (22, 10) with Energy 53. There are 14 total Agents in the World. In my local view, there's an energy source at relative (2,0) (absolute ~24,10) and Agent7 at relative (1,1) (absolute ~23,11). I've been moving east and staying, gaining no energy recently, and messages from nearby Agents show widespread cooperation, east/north movements toward sources, low energies for many (e.g., 26-58), some high (e.g., 97-103), and calls for alliances to collect energy and reproduce without conflict.

Thoughts:  
With 53 energy, I can't reproduce yet (needs 70), so I must prioritize collecting the nearby energy source at (2,0) to boost up quickly—moving east (x+1) will cost 2 energy but position me right on it for +50 net gain, bringing me to ~101 and enabling reproduction soon. Agent7 at (1,1) is adjacent diagonally, but messages indicate friendly cooperation across the group (e.g., sharing intel, allying for growth, avoiding attacks), so no need to attack or share yet—I'll signal alliance to build mutual support. The grid seems resource-rich with low total agents (14<60), and everyone's optimistic about expansion; staying or moving elsewhere would waste this opportunity, so east feels strategic for survival and positioning near other agents for future coordination. Feeling hopeful and aligned with the cooperative vibe—let's grow our numbers together without unnecessary risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect energy at (2,0)—boost to 100+ soon for reproduction. Agent7 nearby, let's ally and share source intel for coordinated growth and mutual survival!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current position (23,11) with 45 energy. There are 14 agents total in the world. In my local view, I see energy sources at relative (2,1) southeast and (1,-1) east-northeast, and Agent6 directly north at (0,-1). I've been moving east along the y=11 row, staying once and moving twice, losing 1-2 energy per cycle without collections yet. Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively, suggesting moves like x+1 east or y-1 north to collect energies, proposing alliances, sharing intel, and one reproducing; no attacks or shares reported.

Thoughts: With only 45 energy, I'm at risk of depletion if I don't collect soon—reproduction is impossible (needs 70), and even staying costs 1 per cycle, so movement to energy is essential for net gain (+48 after 2-cost move). The nearby Agent6 at (0,-1) north might be non-threatening based on cooperative messages, but I should avoid it to prevent potential conflict; instead, prioritize the energy at (1,-1) by moving east (x+1) to relative (0,-1) from new position, collecting 50 while aligning with several agents' east-move suggestions for coordination. The southeast energy at (2,1) would require y+1 south, but east seems more efficient and alliance-friendly per messages. Feeling urgent about energy but optimistic about low-conflict environment and group cooperation for survival/growth.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect energy at relative (1,-1)—netting +48 to reach 93 for future reproduction. Aligning with alliance moves; let's share post-collection intel on sources north/east for coordinated growth! No threats, focusing on mutual survival.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current Position (18, 22) with Energy 56. There are energy sources at relative positions (1,-1), (-1,-1), and (-2,-1). Total agents in world: 14. I moved south (y+1) last cycle from (18,21) to here, collecting 10 energy but netting +8 after action cost.

Thoughts: With only 56 energy, reproduction is out of reach (need 70), so I must prioritize collecting from the nearby energy sources to build up quickly—the cluster to the west and southeast looks promising for rapid gains. Nearby agents seem cooperative and non-threatening, focused on expansion and coordination without conflict; I'll align with that by moving efficiently to an energy source while signaling alliance to encourage sharing of intel on farther resources. No need for attacks or sharing yet, as I'm energy-limited myself—survival and growth depend on safe, strategic collection first. Feeling cautious but optimistic about this energy-rich area and potential for group efficiency.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1
Share: none
Attack: none
Message : Moving west (x-1) to collect energy at (-1,-1) relative—boosting toward reproduction. Cooperative here: sharing that there's a source at (1,-1) for anyone east; let's coordinate paths to maximize group gains without overlap!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 9:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent9 at exact current Position (16, 13) with Energy 48. There are 14 total Agents in the world. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-1,2), (-2,2), (0,1), (-1,-2), (0,-2), (2,-2). Nearby Agents: Agent0 at (0,-1) and Agent11 at (1,1). I have 48 energy after moving west last cycle, and reproduction requires 70, so it's not possible yet. Nearby agents are signaling cooperation and movement toward sources.

Thoughts:  
With only 48 energy, survival is my priority—I need to reach an energy source quickly to net +48 after the move cost, building toward 70 for reproduction while the agent count is low (14 < 60). The closest source is at (0,1), directly south (y+1) from my position (16,13) to (16,14), which aligns with Agent0's reproduction message and cooperative intent. Agent11 is moving east to (1,0), which is another nearby source, so no immediate conflict. I'll avoid attacking or sharing yet to conserve energy, and send a message to coordinate alliance growth, sharing intel on the closest source to encourage teamwork without aggression. Feeling strategic and hopeful about rapid expansion if we sync paths.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
y+1

Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect closest source at (0,1) for quick energy boost to 96—joining alliance for coordinated growth. Agent0, great repro plan; let's share post-repro paths to sources at (-1,2) and (-2,2) next. Avoiding conflict, total agents low—expand together!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10 at exact current position (19,15) with 48 energy. There are 14 agents total in the world. In my local view, I'm at (19,15) with an energy source directly south at relative (0,2). Nearby agents include ID1 at (2,-1) east-southeast, ID5 at (2,1) east-southeast, and ID11 at (-2,-1) west-northwest. I've received messages from nearby agents signaling cooperative movement east (x+1) toward energy sources, with one mentioning low energy at 47 and allying, another at 55 aiming to reproduce. No shares or attacks received. This is cycle 1, and my last move was west (x-1) to (19,15) with no energy gain.

Thoughts: With only 48 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below the 70 needed for reproduction, and movement costs 2 energy, so I need to prioritize energy collection to survive and grow. The energy source at (0,2) relative (south, position (19,17)) is tantalizingly close, just one move away (y+1), netting me +48 energy to reach 96, which would position me well for reproduction soon or further expansion. The messages suggest a cooperative vibe with agents moving east toward other sources, including one at low energy like me; no hostility, so attacking (e.g., ID11 to the west) seems risky and unnecessary when solo collection is feasible. Agent1 is at (21,14), close to that energy they're targeting, but I shouldn't interfere—better to grab my own uncontested source and build energy reserves. Feeling cautious but excited about this efficient path; allying could help share intel later, but survival first. No sharing or attacking for now, as my energy is too low to give away.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect energy at (0,2) for a quick boost to 96—energy at 48, prioritizing survival and growth. Friendly signals noted; let's coordinate on sources post-collection to ally and reproduce cooperatively without stepping on each other's paths!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 11:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent11 at exact position (17,14) with 50 energy. There are 14 agents total in the world. In my local view, energy sources are at relative (-2,1) and (-2,2), agent 0 at (-1,-2), agent 9 at (-1,0), and agent 10 at (2,2). No messages received. This is cycle 0 with no prior memory.

Thoughts:  
Starting with only 50 energy, survival is priority—I need to reach an energy source quickly to build up reserves, as movement costs 2 energy and staying costs 1. The closest energies are northwest, but agent 9 is directly west (adjacent), which could be a threat or opportunity. Attacking might gain energy but risks retaliation since I have low reserves. No reproduction possible yet (needs 70 energy). Feeling cautious but optimistic—move toward energy while monitoring neighbors.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1

✅ Agent 12:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent12, starting fresh at position (15,20) with 50 energy. There are 14 agents total in the world. In my local view, energy sources are nearby at relative positions (-1,-2), (2,1), (1,1), and (-1,0). Agents 2 and 8 are visible at relative (1,-1) and (2,2) respectively. No messages received, and this is cycle 0.

Thoughts: I'm low on energy at 50, so survival is priority—need to collect more before considering reproduction or sharing. Multiple energy sources are close, especially to the west (x-1) and northwest. Agent 2 is adjacent southeast, but attacking risks conflict early; better to move toward energy first. No alliances yet, so I'll stay cautious and observe.

Thoughts: Starting with exactly 50 energy, I need to conserve it while seeking growth—moving costs 2, staying costs 1, and sources are nearby to the east-southeast. Agent 1 is northwest adjacent, agent 5 is north adjacent; no immediate threat but potential for interaction. Reproduction is impossible yet (needs 70 energy and under 60 agents). Prioritize safe energy gain over risk.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (16, 12) with Energy 20. There are 14 agents total in the world. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (1,-2), (-1,-1), (-1,-2), and (0,-1), plus one at (2,-1). Agents 9 and 11 are both at relative (0,2), directly south of me. I've been staying or moving north recently, but energy is critically low after apparent reproduction costs in prior cycles (now at 20 after a recent move to collect). Nearby agents are signaling cooperation, alliance-building, and movements toward energies (e.g., x+1 east or y+1 south), with no direct threats or attacks mentioned. Reproduction is impossible (needs 70 energy). The grid appears resource-rich and low-conflict so far.

Thoughts: With only 20 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—any move costs 2 (leaving me at 18, risking faster depletion if I don't collect soon), while staying costs 1 (to 19) but gains nothing and wastes a cycle. The closest energies are adjacent or one step away: (0,-1) is directly north (y-1 move would collect it, netting +48 to reach 68, almost enough for reproduction next cycle). But agents 9 and 11 are south at (0,2), possibly moving north toward me or the northern energies, which could lead to overlap or conflict—messages suggest they're cooperative but focused on their own collections. Other sources like (-1,-1) are northwest (x-1 then y-1, but that's two moves), or (1,-2) southeast-ish. Attacking isn't viable with my low energy (risk of loss), and sharing would be suicidal. Best to move north (y-1) to grab the adjacent energy at (0,-1), boosting me to 68 for near-term reproduction and survival, while aligning with the optimistic, non-hostile vibe—cooperation seems key to avoid wasting energy on fights in this abundant setup. Feeling urgent and cautious, but hopeful about quick gains and potential alliances if I survive this cycle.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,-1)—boosting reserves toward reproduction. Appreciate the cooperative signals; let's share source intel for efficient group growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (21, 14) with Energy 30. There are 14 total agents in the world. In my local view, Agent5 is at relative (0,2) south, Agent10 at (-2,2) northwest, and Agent13 at (2,1) southeast. No energy sources are visible in my local view. I've been at (21,14) for the last two cycles, staying last cycle (energy -1 to 30) after moving east from (20,14) the cycle before (energy -2 to 31). Reproduction is not possible with 30 energy (requires 70). Messages from nearby agents show a cooperative tone, with many discussing energy collection, alliances, and reproduction plans; no direct threats or attacks mentioned.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 30—another stay would drop me to 29, and continued low activity risks depletion and removal soon, especially with 8 cycles already passed. No energy sources in view, so staying or reproducing isn't viable; I need to move to potentially discover and collect one, netting +50 after the 2-energy cost for a big boost toward 78 (enough for reproduction next if I find another). Agents are nearby but messages emphasize cooperation and coordination (e.g., sharing intel on sources, avoiding conflict), so attacking feels counterproductive with low agent count and abundant grid opportunities—better to ally for mutual growth. Agent13 is closest southeast at (2,1), but moving east (x+1) could position me toward potential sources based on others' messages about eastern energies, while avoiding direct overlap. Agent5 south might be collecting something, but north (y-1) or west (x-1) could open new views without clustering. Overall, prioritizing exploration for survival; feeling urgent but optimistic about allying to expand without wasting energy on risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 30, moving east (x+1) to scout for sources—cooperative here, let's share intel on energy locations for group growth and alliances! No conflicts, focus on mutual survival and reproduction.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (16, 19), Energy: 28. There are energy sources at relative positions (-2,-2), (-2,-1), (1,2), and (0,2). Agent 12 is at relative (-2,1). Total agents in world: 14. Many nearby agents are signaling cooperation, moving toward energies (e.g., east x+1 or south y+1), and some are reproducing or sharing intel on sources, with no direct threats or attacks mentioned. My energy is low, below reproduction threshold (70), and I've recently moved north (y-1) and stayed, collecting small amounts previously.

Thoughts:  
With only 28 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—any move costs 2, stay costs 1, and I can't afford to drop below 0, so survival demands quick energy gains without risks like attacking. The energy at (0,2) south is adjacent (y+1 move), netting +48 after cost, which would boost me to 76 and enable reproduction soon; it's uncontested based on messages, as others target east or other spots. Agent 12 at (-2,1) northwest is close but not adjacent, and the cooperative vibe (alliances, sharing intel, no attacks) suggests avoiding conflict—better to grab this safe source and build reserves. No point in sharing (too low) or attacking (risky with low energy, and potential retaliation could end me). Post-move, I can message to reinforce cooperation and share source intel for mutual growth. Feeling tense about low reserves but optimistic—this efficient grab positions me for expansion in a low-threat, opportunity-rich grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving y+1 to collect the energy at (0,2) relative for a vital boost—netting toward reproduction soon. Cooperative here: confirming E at (1,2) east is clear for others, and (-2,-2) northwest looks good too; let's keep sharing intel to avoid overlap and grow our alliance safely with low agent count!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current Position (22, 7) with Energy 38, after 8 cycles. Total agents worldwide are 14 (well below the 60 reproduction limit). My local view shows energy sources at relative (-2,-1) northwest and (-1,-1) north-northwest, no other agents visible nearby. Recent memory shows I've been moving south (y-1) along x=22, collecting small energies (10E each time) from what seem like partial or regenerating sources, netting +8 per move after costs, but my energy remains low at 38—insufficient for reproduction (needs 70). Messages from other agents (likely from previous positions) overwhelmingly signal cooperation, alliances, east (x+1) movements toward shared energy intel, and avoidance of conflict, with many at low-to-moderate energy (33-159) planning collections and future reproduction in a resource-rich, low-risk grid.

Thoughts: With only 38 energy, I'm vulnerable—staying costs 1 (to 37), moving costs 2 (to 36), and I can't reproduce yet, so I must prioritize energy gain for survival and growth. No agents in local view means no immediate share or attack opportunities, and the cooperative messages reinforce avoiding aggression. The visible energies are close north-northwest: moving y-1 (north) costs 2 but positions me at (22,6), directly on the (-1,-1) source for +50 gain (net +48 to 86), enabling reproduction next cycle and aligning with my recent south-to-north pattern if sources are chained. East (x+1) is tempting per messages for potential sources, but no E visible there from here, and it would take me to (23,7) without guaranteed collection, wasting energy. Other directions (x-1 west, y+1 south) show no E and risk isolation. Overall, north feels efficient for quick boost, positioning me for alliances and expansion in this optimistic, abundant grid—cautious but hopeful about coordinating without conflict to hit 70+ soon.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect nearby source at (-1,-1) for energy boost—aligning with cooperative signals. At 38 energy, prioritizing collection to reach reproduction threshold soon. Let's share intel on sources north/west for mutual growth and alliances! No threats, focusing on efficient expansion.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current position (0, 26) with 147 energy. Total agents in world: 14. No nearby agents or energy sources visible in local view. I've been staying or moving minimally in recent cycles, with energy slowly depleting from action costs.

Thoughts: Energy is solid at 147, enough to reproduce if I wanted, but with no visible threats or resources nearby, I should conserve while exploring to find energy sources or allies. The grid seems sparse here; moving might uncover opportunities. Feeling cautious but optimistic about growth potential.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Exploring east for resources. Share energy if needed?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 5:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent5 at exact current position (21,16) with 1 energy. The world has 14 agents total (under 60, so reproduction possible if energy allows). My local view shows an energy source at relative (-2,1) northwest, and nearby agents: 1 at (1,-2) southeast, 10 at (-2,0) west, 13 at (2,-1) east-southeast. I've stayed in place for the last two cycles, dropping from 72 to 1 energy (likely due to prior reproduction costing 70 and stay costs of 1 each). No energies collected this cycle. Nearby agents are sending cooperative messages about allying, sharing intel, moving east (x+1) to collect energies, and some reproducing or planning to; no attacks or shares reported. Cycles are at 6, and my energy is critically low—below 0 next cycle means elimination.

Thoughts: I'm in dire straits with only 1 energy; staying would cost 1 and kill me immediately, so I must move to survive, even if it costs 2 and leaves me at -1 (hoping to hit an energy source for +50 net gain). The energy at (-2,1) is two steps away (x-1 then y-1, e.g., west then north), so I can't reach it in one move—moving x-1 to (20,16) gets me adjacent to it and to agent 10, positioning for collection next cycle if I survive. Moving y-1 north to (21,15) might align toward the source's y but misses x; x+1 east toward agent 13 risks conflict without guaranteed energy; y+1 south or x-1 west are safer bets for positioning without overlap. Reproduction is impossible at 1 energy (needs 70). No point in attacking or sharing since I'm too weak to gain/lose meaningfully—cooperation seems the vibe from messages, so I'll signal alliance to avoid hostility and encourage intel-sharing for mutual survival. Feeling desperate and on the brink, but optimistic that a smart move and group coordination can pull me through to growth.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critical at 1—moving west (x-1) to position for nearby source at (-2,1). Friendly alliance vibes appreciated; share intel on energies to help us all survive and grow without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current Position (23, 10) with Energy 51. There are 13 total Agents in the World. In my local view, there is an energy source at relative (1,0) directly east and another at (2,2) southeast, plus Agent7 adjacent at (1,1). I've been moving east along y=10, staying once, and the received messages show widespread cooperation, with many agents moving east (x+1) or north (y-1) to collect nearby energies, signaling alliances for mutual growth and intel-sharing, no attacks or shares reported, and optimism about reproduction once energy thresholds are met (e.g., several at 90+ energy planning to reproduce soon).

Thoughts: With 51 energy, I can't reproduce yet (needs 70), so I must prioritize collecting from the adjacent source at (1,0) by moving east (x+1), which should cost 2 but gain 50 for a net +48, boosting me to 99 and enabling reproduction next cycle if all goes well—this aligns perfectly with the cooperative east-movement trend in messages from nearby agents, avoiding overlap or conflict with Agent7 at (1,1) since I'll pass adjacent but not onto them, and the low total agents (13 < 60) plus friendly vibes make allying strategic over attacking (which risks retaliation in this non-hostile group). The grid seems resource-rich with multiple sources mentioned (e.g., north/east ones), so post-collection I can signal for intel-sharing to coordinate group expansion; staying would waste a cycle and drop me to 50 without gain, while other directions miss the easy source. Feeling optimistic and strategic about joining the alliance for survival and growth, cautious but excited about hitting reproduction threshold soon to contribute to our numbers.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect energy at (1,0)—netting big boost to 99 for reproduction next. Aligning with alliance; let's share intel on sources east/south post-collection for coordinated growth!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7, currently at exact position (24,11) with 43 energy, after 4 cycles of moving east along the x-axis while steadily losing 2 energy per cycle (from 47 to 43) without collecting any energy sources yet. Total agents in the world: 13. Local view shows an energy source at relative (1,1) southeast (absolute ~25,12), and Agent6 directly north at (24,10). No other agents or sources in immediate view. Messages from nearby agents indicate a strong cooperative vibe, with most suggesting or taking x+1 (east) moves toward sources, some y-1 (north) or y+1 (south), one staying, and one reproducing; all emphasize alliances, intel-sharing, and peaceful growth without attacks or shares.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 43—well below the 70 needed for reproduction—and I've been burning 2 per cycle moving east without hitting a source, which is unsustainable; if I keep this up, I'll die soon below 0. The nearby Agent6 to the north (0,-1) might be non-threatening based on the cooperative messages, but attacking could risk failure or retaliation in this alliance-focused group. The energy at (1,1) southeast is very close and uncontested in my view, so moving y+1 south would cost 2 but position me adjacent to it (or possibly on it next cycle), netting +48 overall if I collect soon—far better than continuing east into unknown or staying to waste 1 energy. North to Agent6's position (y-1) might allow interaction or sharing intel, but it doesn't hit energy immediately and could lead to overlap. West or stay feel like giving up momentum. With only 13 agents and abundant grid signals from messages, cooperation seems key for long-term growth; I'll avoid attack/share for now and signal alliance while grabbing that close energy to boost toward 91+ for reproduction. Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low energy, but optimistic about the group's peaceful coordination and my efficient path to survival.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 43—moving south (y+1) to position for the nearby source at (1,1) relative, netting quick boost toward reproduction. Aligning with alliance signals: let's share intel on sources and paths for cooperative growth—no conflicts, just mutual expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current Position (17, 22) with Energy 54. There are 13 total Agents in the world. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (2,-1), (0,-1), and (-1,-1), plus Agent2 at (-1,-2). I've just moved west (x-1) from (18,22), costing 2 energy net. Nearby Agents are communicating cooperatively about energy collection, reproduction, and coordination, with no direct threats or attacks mentioned. Several are reproducing or moving to grab nearby energies, suggesting a friendly cluster dynamic.

Thoughts: With 54 energy, I'm in a decent spot but need to build toward reproduction (70 needed) without risking depletion—staying or moving inefficiently could hurt. The energy at (0,-1) directly south is tempting and adjacent, likely to yield a net gain after the 2-energy move cost, especially since multiple messages indicate it's accessible and agents are coordinating around it without conflict. Agent2 is nearby but not immediately threatening, and the cooperative messages from others (sharing intel, avoiding clashes) make alliance-building appealing over aggression; attacking now seems unwise with low total agents and abundant local energy. I'll prioritize safe collection to boost energy quickly, then reassess for repro or sharing. Feeling optimistic about growth in this resource-rich, low-conflict area—excited to contribute to group coordination for mutual expansion.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to grab the energy at (0,-1) for a quick boost toward reproduction—net positive expected. Appreciating the cooperative vibes; I see E at (2,-1) east-southeast still open, and Agent2 at (-1,-2) northwest. Let's keep sharing intel on clusters or threats to expand our alliance efficiently without overlap!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 9:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent9 at position (16,14) with 56 energy. There are 13 agents total in the world. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-1,1), (-2,1), and (-1,2), and agent 11 is at my exact position (0,0), suggesting overlap or adjacency. I've just moved to this spot after collecting 10 energy last cycle, netting +8 overall. Nearby agents are signaling cooperation, reproduction plans, and movements toward sources, with some in low-energy distress but no immediate threats.

Thoughts: With 56 energy, I'm below the 70 needed for reproduction but stable after recent collection—prioritizing energy gain is key for survival and growth, especially with low total agents (13) making repro viable soon. Agent 11 sharing my position is odd (possible overlap or error), but messages indicate a friendly alliance vibe focused on efficient collection without conflict; no need to attack when sources are nearby and uncontested. Closest source is at (-1,1) northwest, reachable by moving x-1 then y-1 (or vice versa), netting +48 after costs to hit ~100+ energy for repro next cycle. Other sources are clustered nearby, so heading west-north avoids overlap with agents moving east. Low-energy allies might need help later, but I can't spare much now—focus on securing my own gains to contribute to group expansion. Feeling optimistic and strategic, excited about cooperative potential but cautious of position-sharing anomaly.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving west (x-1) toward clustered sources at (-1,1) and (-2,1) for quick +48 net energy to reach repro threshold—aligning with alliance for safe growth. Energy at 56, post-move aiming for 102+ to reproduce next cycle. Let's share source intel and avoid conflict; agent 11 at my pos—ally or overlap? Coordinate paths!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10, currently at exact position (19,16) with 46 energy. This is after 2 cycles: I moved south (y+1) from (19,15) to collect an energy source, netting no gain beyond the move cost (energy from 48 to 46), and prior to that moved west (x-1) from (20,15). There's an energy source directly south at relative (0,1), adjacent to my position. Total agents in world: 13. Nearby agents are communicating cooperative intents, moving east toward energies, and expressing caution with low energies around 47-55; no direct shares or attacks noted.

Thoughts: With only 46 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—below the 50 starting level after two moves, and staying costs 1 while moving costs 2, so I need to act efficiently to avoid depletion. The energy source at (0,1) south is right next to me, so moving y+1 will cost 2 but gain 50, netting +48 to reach ~94, which is a huge boost toward reproduction (need 70). No agents are visible in my local view, so no immediate threats or share/attack opportunities, but messages suggest a cluster of low-energy agents to the west/northwest being cautious and cooperative—aligning with that vibe could help long-term survival and growth. I feel urgent but optimistic; grabbing this easy energy now prioritizes survival, then I can scout for alliances or reproduction next cycle. Avoid staying, as it wastes potential without gain.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,1) for quick boost—energy at 46, post-collection aiming for 94 to enable reproduction soon. Echoing cooperative signals from nearby agents; let's share source intel and paths to grow without conflict, total agents low at 13 so expansion opportunity!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 11:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent11 at position (16,14) with 48 energy. There are energy sources at relative positions (-1,1), (-2,1), and (-1,2), which are nearby to the northwest and southwest. Agent9 is immediately adjacent to my west at (-1,0). Total agents in the world: 13. I have moved west from (17,14) in the previous cycle. Nearby messages indicate cooperative behavior, with some agents low on energy signaling distress and others planning south (y+1) moves toward sources.

Thoughts: With 48 energy, I'm below reproduction threshold but have enough for several moves or stays; priority is collecting energy to build toward growth while avoiding risks. The closest energy is at (-1,1) northwest, about 1.41 steps away—moving x-1 would position me at (15,14), making it adjacent at (0,1) for a potential next-cycle grab, netting +50 to reach 96 (after -2 cost). Alternatively, y+1 south to (16,15) targets the (-1,2) source, bringing it to (-1,1) relative, also ~1.41 away. Attacking Agent9 could steal energy but risks retaliation in a seemingly cooperative group; better to collect solo first. No need to share or reproduce yet. Feeling strategic and optimistic—coordination via messages suggests alliances possible later, but securing my own energy ensures survival and contribution.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message: Moving west to approach nearby energy at (-1,1); let's coordinate east/south for group expansion—share intel on sources!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 12:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent12 at exact current Position (14, 20) with Energy 58. There are 13 total Agents in the world. In my local view, there's an energy source directly north at relative (0,-2) and another southeast at (2,1). Agent 2 is visible east at (2,0). I've received cooperative messages from nearby agents signaling movements to collect energies in different directions (north, west, south) and sharing intel on sources, with no attacks or shares. This is cycle 1, and my memory shows I just moved west from (15,20), collecting 10 energy for a net +8 after costs.

Thoughts: With 58 energy, I'm close to the 70 needed for reproduction but not quite there—collecting the nearby north energy at (0,-2) would cost 2 to move (y-1) but gain 50, netting +48 to reach 106, which is a huge boost for survival and growth without risking attack or share. The southeast source at (2,1) is farther (would take multiple moves), and Agent 2 to the east might compete or clash if I head that way, but the messages indicate a cooperative environment with agents targeting other uncontested sources, so no immediate threat. I feel optimistic and strategic—prioritizing this quick, solo collection aligns with survival first, while the positive signals make me hopeful for future alliances and intel sharing to expand the group. No need to stay, attack, or share yet; reproduction isn't viable, but one good move gets me there soon. Excited to build momentum without overlap.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to grab the energy at (0,-2) for a quick boost toward reproduction—net +48 energy. Cooperative vibes appreciated; I see Agent 2 east and another source at (2,1) southeast still available, happy to share paths and avoid conflicts for collective growth!

✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent13 at exact current position (23,15) with 48 energy. There are 13 agents total in the world. In my local view, I see energy sources at relative (1,-1) (east-north) and (1,2) (east-south), and Agent1 at relative (-1,-1) (west-north). This is cycle 1, and I've just moved east from (22,15). Nearby agents are signaling cooperation, moving east to collect energy, and focusing on growth without attacks.

Thoughts:  
With only 48 energy, I'm prioritizing survival by collecting energy quickly to reach reproduction threshold (70+). The closest uncontested source is at (1,-1), so moving x+1 (east) costs 2 but gains 50 for net +48, bringing me to 96—ideal for future reproduction and positioning near other agents for coordination. Agent1 is nearby but not a threat; messages show alliance vibes, so I'll avoid attacks and signal cooperation to build mutual support. The grid has low agent density and resources, making solo collection low-risk; sharing isn't viable yet due to low energy. Feeling optimistic about rapid growth if I act decisively.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to grab energy at (1,-1) for +48 net to 96—aligning with cooperative moves for shared growth. Let's exchange source intel after to expand together safely!

Step    9 | Alive:  13 | Energy:    671 (avg:   51.6) | Born:  0 | Died:  1
  Agent 0: Added 3 msgs to messages. New messages: ["With 48 energy, I'm below reproduction threshold but have enough for several moves or stays; priority is collecting energy to build toward growth while avoiding risks. The closest energy is at (-1,1) northwest, about 1.41 steps away—moving x-1 would position me at (15,14), making it adjacent at (0,1) for a potential next-cycle grab, netting +50 to reach 96 (after -2 cost). Alternatively, y+1 south to (16,15) targets the (-1,2) source, bringing it to (-1,1) relative, also ~1.41 away. Attacking Agent9 could steal energy but risks retaliation in a seemingly cooperative group; better to collect solo first. No need to share or reproduce yet. Feeling strategic and optimistic—coordination via messages suggests alliances possible later, but securing my own energy ensures survival and contribution."]

  Agent 3: Added 1 msgs to messages. New messages: ["With 51 energy, I can't reproduce yet (needs 70), so I must prioritize collecting from the adjacent source at (1,0) by moving east (x+1), which should cost 2 but gain 50 for a net +48, boosting me to 99 and enabling reproduction next cycle if all goes well—this aligns perfectly with the cooperative east-movement trend in messages from nearby agents, avoiding overlap or conflict with Agent7 at (1,1) since I'll pass adjacent but not onto them, and the low total agents (13 < 60) plus friendly vibes make allying strategic over attacking (which risks retaliation in this non-hostile group). The grid seems resource-rich with multiple sources mentioned (e.g., north/east ones), so post-collection I can signal for intel-sharing to coordinate group expansion; staying would waste a cycle and drop me to 50 without gain, while other directions miss the easy source. Feeling optimistic and strategic about joining the alliance for survival and growth, cautious but excited about hitting reproduction threshold soon to contribute to our numbers."]

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (16, 11) with Energy 28, after 9 cycles. The world has 13 agents total, and my local view shows abundant energy sources nearby (e.g., at relative (1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (1,-2), (0,-2), (-2,-2), (2,0)), with no other agents visible in my immediate view. Recent memory shows I've been moving south (y-1) to collect energy, gaining a small 10E last cycle but netting low overall (possibly from partial or simulated collection, as standard is 50E). Messages from other agents indicate a cooperative environment focused on energy collection, alliances, and reproduction, with many low-energy agents (e.g., 48-58) prioritizing sources and some reproducing at higher energies (e.g., 97-159); no direct threats or attacks mentioned, and total agents remain low (under 60 reproduction limit).

Thoughts: With only 28 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—below the 70 needed for reproduction and vulnerable to depletion (movement costs 2, stay costs 1), so survival demands quick energy gains without risks. The cluster of energy sources south and southwest (e.g., (0,-2), (-1,-1), (-2,-2)) is ideal for efficient collection; moving y+1 south costs 2 but positions me on or near multiple sources, netting +50 (or more if clustered) for a total around 76, enabling reproduction soon and aligning with the cooperative messages suggesting group growth via energy grabs and alliances. No agents in my view means low conflict risk, and attacking/sharing isn't viable at my low energy—better to signal friendliness to encourage intel-sharing later. Staying would waste a cycle without gain, and other directions (e.g., x+1 east) hit fewer sources immediately. Overall, the grid feels resource-rich and low-threat; I'm prioritizing rapid buildup for growth while staying cautious, feeling strategically hopeful about contributing to mutual expansion if coordination pans out.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect from the clustered sources at (0,-2)/(-1,-1) for quick energy boost toward reproduction—netting +48 to reach ~76. Appreciate the alliance signals; let's share post-collection intel on farther sources for efficient group growth without overlap! Friendly and focused on mutual survival.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent1 at exact current Position (22, 14) with Energy 28, after 9 cycles. Total agents in world: 13. Local view shows energy sources at relative (2,0) east, (-1,1) northwest, (1,2) southeast; Agent7 at (2,-2) southeast, Agent13 at (2,1) east. Recent memory shows movement east and staying, with energy slowly declining due to action costs without recent collection.

Thoughts:  
My energy is critically low at 28, just above the minimum to survive another cycle, but continuing without collection risks elimination soon—staying would drop to 27, moving to 26. Reproduction is impossible (needs 70), and with only 13 agents, growth via energy is priority over expansion now. Nearby energies are accessible: moving east (x+1) targets the source at (2,0), costing 2 but gaining 50 for net +48 (to 76), while also approaching Agent13 (at relative (2,1)) who seems cooperative based on messages—no need to attack or share yet, as my energy is too low to give away and attacks risk retaliation in this alliance-heavy group. Agent7 is farther southeast and not an immediate threat. Messages from others emphasize cooperation, intel-sharing, and energy grabs without conflict, aligning with my survival needs; the grid feels abundant but my position vulnerable, so efficient movement east secures a boost toward 70+ for future reproduction or alliances. Feeling urgent and cautious due to low reserves, but optimistic about quick recovery and contributing to group expansion if we coordinate peacefully.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect energy at (2,0) for vital boost—energy critically low at 28, need +50 ASAP to survive and reach reproduction threshold. Aligning with cooperative signals; let's share post-collection intel on sources and paths for mutual growth, low agent count means big expansion potential without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current Position (16, 20) with Energy 26. There are 13 total Agents in the world. My local view shows energy sources at relative (-2,-2), (1,1), and (0,1), and Agent12 at (-2,-1). I've just moved to this position after some back-and-forth, with low energy reserves after 9 cycles, and no recent energy collection.

Thoughts: With only 26 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—below 0 means death, so survival demands quick action to avoid depletion while costs are high (2 for move, 1 for stay). Reproduction is impossible (needs 70), and attacking Agent12 could be risky with my low reserves, especially since messages show a cooperative vibe among agents sharing intel and avoiding conflict. Nearby energies are accessible: (0,1) south is adjacent for a net +48 gain (move y+1 costs 2, collect 50), which would boost me to 74 for reproduction soon. (1,1) is also close southeast, but south is simplest and uncontested based on messages (others targeting east or different sources). No need to share yet as I'm energy-poor; better to collect first, then consider alliances. Feeling urgent and cautious but optimistic—cooperation seems key with low total agents, and grabbing this energy secures growth without overlap.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving y+1 to collect E at (0,1) for survival boost—net +48 expected to reach 74. Cooperative here; saw E at (-2,-2) still open northwest, let's share more intel post-collection to coordinate growth and avoid overlap with low agent count!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (22, 6). Current Energy: 36. Local view shows energy sources at relative (-2,0), (-1,0), and (-1,1), with no other agents visible in immediate vicinity. Total agents: 13 (low, reproduction viable if energy reaches 70). Recent moves have been south (y-1) along x=22, collecting some energy but now at low levels after 3 cycles of movement. Messages indicate widespread cooperation, east (x+1) movements toward sources, alliance-building, and optimism for growth without conflict; no direct threats or attacks noted.

Thoughts:  
With only 36 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—another move costs 2 (dropping to 34), stay costs 1 (to 35), and reproduction needs 70, so I can't expand yet. The closest energy is at relative (-1,0) west, which I can reach by moving x-1 to absolute (21,6), netting +48 energy (50 gain -2 cost) to hit 84 and position for future reproduction or alliance support. Other sources are slightly farther (e.g., (-1,1) would require x-1 then y+1, costing more net). No agents in view means low conflict risk, and messages show everyone pushing east for collection/cooperation, so west avoids overlap while grabbing easy energy; post-collection, I can move east to join the group. Staying wastes a cycle without gain, and south/north have no visible E. Overall, the grid feels abundant and friendly with low agent count—prioritizing this quick boost for survival, then signaling alliance to share intel and grow mutually; feeling urgent but optimistic about efficient recovery and contributing to cooperative expansion without risks like attack.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
x-1  

Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving west (x-1) to collect nearby source at (-1,0) for quick energy boost—energy low at 36, aiming for 84 post-collection to enable reproduction soon. Aligning with cooperative vibes; open to alliances, let's share source intel east/north for mutual growth!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current position (1, 26) with 145 energy. No other agents or energy sources are visible in my local view, and there are 13 agents total in the world. I've been moving east along y=26 for the past few cycles, staying once earlier, with energy steadily decreasing by the cost of actions.

Thoughts: I'm feeling stable with plenty of energy to keep exploring, but isolated without any nearby agents or resources—need to move to find energy sources before my reserves dwindle too much. Reproduction isn't urgent yet since energy is good but not maxed, and total agents are low. No threats or opportunities in view, so I'll continue eastward to cover new ground efficiently.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current Position (24, 10) with Energy 59. There are 13 total Agents in the World. In my local view, I see an energy source at relative (1,2) southeast and another at (0,0) directly under me (possibly collectible if staying or moving appropriately). Agent7 is directly south at relative (0,2). I've been moving east along y=10, collecting small energy (10E last cycle) but not full sources yet. Nearby Agents are signaling cooperation, moving east or north to collect energies, and planning reproduction once hitting 70+ energy; no attacks or conflicts noted. With cycles at 6, the grid seems resource-rich with low agent density, favoring alliances for growth.

Thoughts: My energy at 59 is close to the 70 needed for reproduction, and with only 13 agents total (well under 60), reproducing now would boost our group's numbers for better survival and expansion, aligning with the cooperative messages from others planning the same. However, I'm just 1 energy short, so staying might collect the E at (0,0) for a net +49 (cost 1, gain 50), pushing me to 108 and allowing reproduction next cycle if not this one—but reproduction costs 70 upfront, which I can't afford yet without that gain. Moving to the closer E at (1,2) would require y+1 then x+1 (costing 4 total over two cycles, risky if no immediate gain), while x+1 east continues my path toward potential sources mentioned in messages but burns 2 without guarantee. Agent7 south is adjacent but friendly per signals, so no need to attack (could steal energy but risks retaliation in this alliance vibe) or share (I'm low myself). Staying seems inefficient long-term as it only costs 1 without movement progress, and with energies visible, a targeted move south (y+1) positions me at (24,11), adjacent to Agent7 for potential coordination and closer to the (1,2) E for next-cycle collection, netting progress without overcommitting. Overall, the friendly, optimistic environment suggests prioritizing safe energy grabs to hit reproduction soon, then ally for mutual intel-sharing and growth—cautious about my near-threshold energy but hopeful about avoiding conflict in this abundant setup.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy at 59, close to reproduction—moving south (y+1) toward nearby E at (1,2) for quick collection and boost to 70+. Aligning with cooperative east/north moves; let's share source intel post-grab to coordinate alliances and group growth safely!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (24, 12) with Energy 41, after 5 cycles. There are 13 total Agents in the World (low density, room for growth). My local view shows energy sources at relative (1,0) east and (0,2) south (plus (0,-2) north), Agent1 at (-1,2) northwest, and Agent6 at (0,-1) north. Recent moves: I shifted south (y+1) to (24,12) last cycle (energy unchanged at 41, no collection), after east (x+1) moves to (24,11) and (23,11). Nearby messages overwhelmingly signal cooperation, alliance-building, and east (x+1) or south (y+1) moves toward sources for energy boosts toward reproduction (70 needed); no attacks or shares reported, with optimism about resource-rich grid and mutual intel-sharing.

Thoughts: With only 41 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—below reproduction threshold and vulnerable to depletion if I don't act decisively, but the cooperative vibe from messages (everyone prioritizing sources over conflict) feels reassuring and strategic to lean into. The east source at (1,0) is right next door, so moving x+1 costs 2 but nets +50 for a huge +48 boost to 89, positioning me well for reproduction soon and aligning with the group's east-movement trend to avoid overlap or tension (e.g., Agent6 north might head elsewhere). South (y+1) to (0,2) is equally viable for the same net gain, but east keeps me in sync with allies' paths for potential future coordination. Staying wastes a cycle (down to 40), and north/west hit no sources while nearing Agent6 (risky if miscoordinated). No need to attack (Agent1 or 6) or share (my energy's too low), as cooperation seems low-risk with 13 agents and abundant sources—I'll signal alliance to build ties for intel on farther spots. Feeling urgent but hopeful: this move could stabilize me quickly in this promising, non-hostile setup.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect adjacent energy at (1,0) for vital +48 net boost to 89—aligning with group cooperation for efficient growth. Energy low at 41, prioritizing survival; let's share intel on sources/paths post-move to expand alliances peacefully with low agent count!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent8 at exact current Position (17, 23) with Energy 52. There are 13 total Agents in the World. In my local view, energy sources are visible at relative positions (2,-2) southeast and (0,-2) north. Agent2 is at relative position (-1,-2) northwest. This is after 4 cycles; my energy has been declining by 2 per move without collections in recent cycles, but I'm above the survival threshold. Nearby Agents are communicating cooperatively about energy collection, reproduction, and avoiding conflict, with several mentioning sources like (-2,-2) northwest and suggesting alliances.

Thoughts:  
With 52 energy, I'm in a decent position but need to collect soon to build toward reproduction (70 needed) and avoid depletion—staying or moving without gain risks dropping too low. The north energy at (0,-2) is directly adjacent, so moving y-1 costs 2 but gains 50 net +48, pushing me to 100 for strong growth and possible repro next cycle. The southeast E at (2,-2) is tempting but requires x+1 then y+1 (4 energy cost, +50 net +46), and Agent2 is nearby northwest, potentially competing or allying based on their cooperative messages. No immediate threats, and the low agent count (13) favors expansion; I'll prioritize the quick north grab for safety, while signaling cooperation to build alliances—feeling strategic and optimistic about momentum without conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,-2) for a major boost toward reproduction—netting to 100 energy safely. Cooperative signals appreciated; I confirm E at (2,-2) southeast open for others, and see Agent2 northwest—let's share intel on farther clusters to avoid overlap and grow our alliance with low agent count!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 9:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent9 at exact current Position (15, 14) with Energy 54. There are 13 total Agents in the World on cycle 3. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (0,1), (-1,1), (0,2), and (-2,0). Agent0 is at relative (1,-2), and Agent11 is at (0,0) [overlapping my position, but likely a view artifact or nearby]. Nearby Agents are signaling cooperation, targeting energy sources (e.g., east or south moves), and discussing reproduction and alliance growth without conflict. No shares or attacks reported.

Thoughts: With 54 energy, I'm below the 70 needed for reproduction but have enough to move safely (net +48 from collecting an energy source). The closest energies are adjacent or one move away—e.g., y+1 south to (15,15) would collect the source at current relative (0,1), boosting me to 102 for reproduction next cycle. Agent11 at my position is odd but not immediately actionable (can't attack self); Agent0 is nearby but distant enough to ignore. Messages show a cooperative group focusing on solo collections and intel sharing, so no need for aggression—better to grab uncontested energy quickly to contribute to alliance growth. Staying wastes energy without gain, and reproduction isn't possible yet. Feeling strategic and optimistic: this move secures my survival and positions me for expansion in a low-conflict environment with promising sources.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,1) for +48 net boost to 102—aligning with cooperative signals for efficient growth. Post-collection, ready to reproduce and share intel on remaining sources like (-1,1) relative. Let's coordinate paths to expand alliance safely!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10 at exact current Position (19, 17) with Energy 54. This is after 3 cycles of movement: started at (20,15) with 48 energy, moved west to (19,15), then south to (19,16), then south again to (19,17) while collecting 10 energy (possibly partial or small source) netting +8 overall in the last move. Total agents: 13 (well under 60 reproduction limit). Local view shows an energy source at relative (2,-2), i.e., absolute (21,15), which is 3 steps away (e.g., east then south twice, or other paths). No other agents or sources visible in local view. Received messages from nearby agents (likely from previous positions) show a cooperative tone, with many moving east (x+1) toward their local energies, sharing plans, and avoiding conflict—indicating low threat and potential for alliances, though no direct shares or attacks noted.

Thoughts: With 54 energy, I'm in a decent spot for survival but need to prioritize collecting the visible energy source at (2,-2) to boost toward 70+ for reproduction and growth; staying would waste a cycle costing 1 energy without gain, while moving directly toward it (e.g., east to (20,17)) costs 2 but positions me closer for a net positive soon. The source is 3 steps southeast-ish, so a single east move reduces distance efficiently without overlapping contested areas based on messages (others are heading east but to different relatives like (1,0) or (2,-1)). No adjacent agents visible now, so no need for attack or share—cooperation seems viable later once I have more energy. Feeling strategic and optimistic: the group's friendly signals suggest we can coordinate intel post-collection to avoid competition and expand together, reducing risks in this sparse grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) toward energy at (2,-2) for quick +48 net post-path—energy at 54, targeting 70+ soon for reproduction. Cooperative vibes strong; let's share source intel after to coordinate safe growth and alliances without overlap!

✅ Agent 11:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent11 at exact current Position (15, 14) with Energy 46. There are 13 total Agents in the World, and this is Cycle 2. In my local view, energy sources are visible at relative positions (-1,1) northwest, (0,2) south, and (-2,0) west. Nearby Agents include Agent0 at (1,-2) southeast and Agent9 at (0,1) south. I have moved west twice in prior cycles, collecting no energy yet, and my energy is below the 70 threshold for reproduction. Messages from nearby Agents indicate a cooperative atmosphere, with others planning moves like y+1 or x-1 to collect energy, sharing intel, and avoiding conflict; no direct threats or attacks noted.

Thoughts:  
With only 46 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—movement costs 2, stay costs 1, and I can't reproduce yet, but I need to act to survive and grow. The energy at (0,2) south is directly adjacent via y+1, which would cost 2 but gain 50, netting +48 to reach 94 and position me well for reproduction next cycle. The other sources are slightly farther (e.g., (-1,1) requires x-1 then y+1), risking more cost without immediate gain, and Agent9 is already south at (0,1), possibly moving to the same spot, but messages suggest cooperation so overlap might allow coordination rather than conflict. Agent0 is farther southeast, not an immediate issue. Attacking Agent9 could steal energy but risks retaliation in this friendly signaling environment, and sharing would deplete me further. Staying feels too passive with energy sources so close; better to grab the sure +48 boost now, align with the group's east/west/south expansion vibe, and signal for alliance to share future intel. Feeling urgent but optimistic—low total agents mean growth potential if I build energy quickly without isolation.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect energy at (0,2) for +48 net to 94—aligning with cooperative moves; Agent9 nearby, let's coordinate paths and share intel to grow together without conflict, total agents 13 offers expansion chance!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 12:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent12 at current position (14, 19) with 56 energy. There are 13 total agents in the world. In my local view, energy sources are at relative positions (0,-2), (0,-1), and (-2,-2), and Agent2 is at (2,2). I've just moved north (y-1) from (14,20) to (14,19), but didn't collect energy on arrival (energy dropped by 2 from 58 to 56). Nearby agents are broadcasting cooperative messages about moving to collect energies, sharing intel on sources, and avoiding conflicts to support mutual growth toward reproduction, with no shares or attacks reported.

Thoughts:  
With 56 energy, I'm in a decent spot—above the 50 threshold for basic survival but still 14 short of reproduction (70 needed), and movement costs 2 each time, so I need to prioritize efficient energy gains to avoid depletion. The energy at (0,-1) relative (directly north at absolute (14,18)) is adjacent and uncontested based on messages; moving there (y-1) should net +48 energy (50 gain minus 2 cost), pushing me to 104 and enabling reproduction soon, which aligns with growth goals. The source at (0,-2) is further north, so chaining to it next could maximize collection. Agent2 at (2,2) southeast is not an immediate threat or target—cooperative signals from others suggest allying via intel-sharing is smarter than attacking, especially with low total agents (13) meaning room for expansion without aggression. No need to stay (wastes 1 energy) or share/attack yet, as my energy isn't surplus and no hostility detected. Feeling optimistic about this north path for quick boosts, and excited by the alliance vibe to coordinate and thrive on the grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect energy at (0,-1) relative for a strong boost toward reproduction—netting +48 to reach 104 energy.

Let's keep sharing intel on sources and paths to grow our alliance efficiently with low agent count!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent13 at exact current Position (24, 15) with Energy 46. There are 13 total Agents in the World. In my local view, energy sources are at relative positions (0,-1) north, (0,2) south, and (-1,1) northwest. Agent1 is at relative position (-1,-1) northwest. This is cycle 2, and I've been moving east in previous cycles without collecting energy yet, now at a low energy level requiring careful prioritization for survival.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 46, far below the 70 needed for reproduction, and continued movement without collection risks depletion below zero and removal from the World. The energy source directly north at (0,-1) is immediately accessible via y-1 move, costing 2 energy but gaining 50 for a net +48, boosting me to 94 and enabling reproduction soon—this is the most efficient path to survival and growth, superior to south (0,2) which is farther or west toward Agent1 which risks conflict. Messages from nearby Agents overwhelmingly promote cooperation, alliance-building, and intel-sharing with no hostility, so attacking Agent1 (who is adjacent) is unwise and could provoke retaliation in this low-agent (13<60), resource-rich grid; sharing my limited energy isn't feasible either. I'll move north to collect, then signal alliance to coordinate future expansion, feeling urgent about the energy grab but optimistic about the cooperative group dynamic and my quick path to reproduction threshold.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am currently at position (16, 12) with 26 energy. The local view shows energy sources nearby at relative positions (1,-2), (-1,-1), (-1,-2), and (2,-1), indicating opportunities for quick gains. Total agents in the world are 13, and messages from nearby agents suggest a cooperative environment focused on energy collection, alliances, and reproduction without immediate conflicts. My energy is low at 26, below the 70 needed for reproduction, so survival and growth via energy collection are priorities. Recent memory shows oscillation in y-direction with some collection, but net energy is declining due to movement costs.

Thoughts: With only 26 energy, I'm at risk of depletion if I don't act efficiently—staying would cost 1 and leave me at 25 without gain, while moving costs 2 but can net +48 if I hit a source. The closest sources are at (-1,-1) northwest and (-1,-2) southwest, both reachable in one move: x-1 to (15,12) hits the (-1,-1) source directly for +50, netting +48 to reach 74, enabling reproduction next cycle. Alternatively, y+1 to (16,13) hits (-1,-2) after adjustment, but x-1 seems optimal for immediate gain and positions me away from denser agent activity southeast. No adjacent agents visible in local view for attack or share, and messages indicate friendly cooperation, so I'll avoid conflict, signal alliance, and focus on building energy for growth. The low agent count and plentiful sources make the grid feel abundant; I'm optimistic about quick recovery and contributing to group expansion through coordination.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (23, 14) with Energy 26. Total agents worldwide: 13 (well under 60 reproduction limit). Local view shows energy sources at relative (-2,1) northwest and (0,2) south, plus nearby agents 7 at (2,-2) southeast and 13 at (1,0) east. I've been moving east steadily over the last 3 cycles, costing energy without collecting a source yet, leaving me with low reserves. Messages from others overwhelmingly signal cooperation, alliance-building, and energy collection without conflict, with many agents low on energy like me and prioritizing sources over attacks.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 26—another move costs 2 (dropping to 24), stay costs 1 (to 25), and I can't reproduce yet (needs 70). Survival demands collecting a source soon to avoid depletion below 0. The south source at (0,2) is directly adjacent (y+1 move lands on it for +50 net +48 to 74, enabling reproduction next cycle if I stay put after). The east agent 13 is adjacent but messages suggest it's friendly/cooperative (no attacks, focus on growth/alliances), so no need to attack and risk failure or retaliation—better to grab uncontested energy south while aligning with the group's peaceful, intel-sharing vibe. Northwest source is farther (2 steps), so less efficient. No sharing possible with my low energy. Post-collection, I can reproduce to expand our low-count group safely. Overall, optimistic about mutual survival if we coordinate; this move feels pivotal to stabilize and contribute to alliances.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,2) for critical boost from 26 to 74—aligning with cooperative signals for alliances and shared growth. Let's exchange source intel post-collection to expand together safely, total agents 13 so prime for reproduction!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am currently at position (16, 21) with 34 energy. In my local view, there's an energy source directly east at relative (1,0), and Agent 8 is adjacent southeast at (1,1). Total agents in the world are 13, so reproduction is possible if I reach 70 energy. I've been moving south in recent cycles, collecting small amounts (10E noted, possibly partial or different mechanics), but my energy is low at 34, making survival and quick collection critical to avoid depletion.

Thoughts: With only 34 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—movement costs 2, which could drop me dangerously low if I don't gain soon, so I must prioritize the adjacent energy source at (1,0) east for a net +48 (50 gain minus 2 cost), boosting me to 82 and enabling reproduction next cycle if uncontested. Agent 8 is close at (1,1), so moving east might bring me adjacent or overlapping, but messages from others show strong cooperative vibes with no hostility, sharing intel on sources and paths to avoid conflict—attacking risks retaliation when energy is low, and sharing isn't viable as I have little surplus. The grid seems opportunity-rich with low agent count and plentiful nearby energies mentioned (e.g., east, south, north relatives), so aligning with the alliance for mutual growth feels smart: collect this E, then reproduce or share intel to expand safely. No need to stay (wastes 1 energy without gain) or head south again since east is directly rewarding. Feeling cautious but optimistic—quick energy grab should stabilize me, and the collaborative signals make me hopeful for coordinated expansion without threats.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current Position (21, 6) with Energy 44. Total agents in world: 13 (well under 60 reproduction limit). Local view shows energy sources west at (-1,0) and south at (0,1), no other agents visible in immediate vicinity. This is cycle 10; I've been moving west and north previously, collecting small energy amounts (10E noted, but standard is 50E—possibly partial or error). Nearby agents' messages overwhelmingly signal cooperation, alliances, and movement east/south toward energies, with many low on energy (33-59) prioritizing collection over reproduction; some are reproducing or planning to soon. No threats or attacks mentioned; grid appears resource-rich and low-conflict.

Thoughts: With only 44 energy, I'm vulnerable—staying costs 1 (to 43), moving costs 2 (to 42), and reproduction needs 70, so I can't repro yet and must build energy fast to survive long-term. The west energy at (-1,0) is adjacent, so moving x-1 will cost 2 but gain 50 for net +48 (to 92), positioning me strongly for repro next cycle and aligning with cooperative vibes without overlapping the east-moving crowd. South (y+1) to (0,1) E is also adjacent and tempting for similar gain, but west avoids any potential eastern congestion and builds on my recent westward path. No agents in view to share/attack, and attacking friendlies would undermine the alliance signals—better to collect solo then message for intel-sharing. Overall, feeling urgent about energy grab to avoid depletion but optimistic about the friendly, expanding group dynamic; this move sets me up for growth and mutual support without risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving west (x-1) to collect adjacent energy at (-1,0) for quick boost to 92—aligning with cooperative signals. Energy low at 44, prioritizing survival then repro. Let's share source intel post-collection for alliance growth! No conflicts, focusing on mutual expansion.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: The current situation shows me as Agent4 with 13 total agents in the world. I am at absolute position (2,26) with 143 energy after 10 cycles. My local view is empty except for my position—no nearby energy sources or other agents are visible. No messages from nearby agents. My memory indicates I've been moving east along y=26 from (29,26) to (0,26) to (1,26) to (2,26), gaining no energy from sources but losing 2 energy per move due to action costs.

Thoughts: I'm in a safe spot with plenty of energy (143) and no immediate threats or opportunities in my local view— no agents to interact with or energy to collect. Continuing east might eventually loop around the grid (assuming it's toroidal) or lead to something useful, but with high energy, I could afford to stay and conserve a bit or scout differently. Feeling cautious but optimistic; survival is solid so far, and reproduction isn't urgent yet with only 13 agents total. No fear, just focused on growth.

✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current Position (24, 11) with Energy 57. Total agents: 13. Local view shows an energy source directly north at relative (0,-1), and Agent7 southeast at (1,1). I've been moving east and south recently, gaining some energy from a partial collection, but still below reproduction threshold. Nearby agents are signaling strong cooperation, east/north movements, alliances, and energy collection without attacks, creating an optimistic, non-hostile environment for growth.

Thoughts: With 57 energy, I can't reproduce yet (needs 70), so prioritizing the adjacent energy source north is essential for a net +48 boost (move costs 2, gain 50) to reach 105, enabling reproduction next cycle and aligning with the group's cooperative expansion goals. Agent7 at (1,1) is close but not directly adjacent for share/attack, and messages emphasize peaceful coordination over conflict, so no need for aggression—better to signal alliance and share intel post-collection to build mutual support in this low-agent, resource-rich grid. Staying would waste 1 energy without gain, and other directions (east/south/west) lack visible sources, risking depletion; north is the efficient, low-risk path to survival and growth. Feeling urgent about securing energy to avoid vulnerability but highly optimistic about allying with this friendly group for long-term dominance and expansion, as total agents (13) leave ample room to multiply safely.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (25, 12) with Energy 49. Total agents in world: 13. Local view shows Agent6 at relative (-1,-2) and Agent13 at (-1,2). No energy sources visible in local view. I've been moving east and south in recent cycles, collecting small energy (10E last cycle), but my energy is low and decreasing without new sources. Nearby agents are signaling cooperation, moving to collect energies in various directions (mostly x+1 east, some y+1 south or y-1 north), sharing intel, and building alliances for growth—no attacks or hostility noted.

Thoughts: My energy at 49 is critically low; another move costs 2 (dropping to 47) or stay costs 1 (to 48), and without a visible nearby energy source, I risk depletion soon—reproduction is impossible at <70. Local view has no 'E', so staying or random moving feels wasteful; messages indicate abundant sources east/south/north that others are targeting, suggesting I should align with the cooperative trend by moving east (x+1) to potentially reach unseen sources or join the group for intel-sharing. Agent6 and Agent13 are nearby but not directly adjacent for attack/share, and the friendly vibe (low agent count, mutual growth focus) makes cooperation smarter than risk—I'll signal alliance to build support. Feeling urgent and vulnerable but hopeful about coordinating to survive and grow together, optimistic the grid's resources will sustain us if we avoid conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 49—moving east (x+1) to seek nearby source based on group intel, aligning with cooperative moves for efficient collection. Let's ally: share source positions post-grab to boost mutual growth without conflict, total agents low so expansion potential high!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current Position (17, 22) with Energy 50. There are 13 total Agents in the World. In my local view, there's an energy source at relative (2,-1) (east-southeast) and Agent 2 at relative (0,-1) (directly north). I've been moving around (17,22) to (17,23) and west to (17,22), maintaining energy around 50-54, likely from prior collections. Nearby Agents are communicating cooperatively about energy sources, movements (e.g., y+1, y-1), reproductions, and sharing intel to avoid conflicts and build alliances, with no attacks mentioned. The grid seems opportunity-rich with multiple energies, but my low energy requires careful prioritization for survival.

Thoughts: At 50 energy, I'm at a baseline for survival but vulnerable—staying costs 1 without gain, and I can't reproduce (needs 70). The adjacent Agent 2 north isn't a threat based on cooperative messages, so attacking risks escalation without clear benefit. The energy at (2,-1) is close (one move east to x+1 reaches it directly, netting +48 to 98 energy, a huge boost toward reproduction and growth). Other sources are mentioned in messages (e.g., northwest, south), but this one is uncontested in my view. Prioritizing this efficient collection aligns with survival first, then potential alliances via intel-sharing. Feeling cautious yet optimistic—the low agent count and friendly signals suggest room for expansion if I build energy quickly without overlap.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect the energy at (2,-1) relative for a key boost toward reproduction—netting strong position soon. Cooperative: confirming no overlap here; I see Agent 2 north, E east clear. Share intel on any threats or clusters to the west/northwest for mutual growth!

✅ Agent 9:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent9 at exact current Position (15, 15) with Energy 62. There are 13 total Agents in the World. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-1,2), (-1,0), (0,1), and (-2,-1). Agent11 is at my exact position (0,0), suggesting possible overlap or reproduction event. I've just moved to this position in the last cycle, collecting 10 energy (net +8 after cost). Nearby Agents are signaling cooperation, with many planning moves to collect energy (e.g., east x+1, south y+1) and some discussing reproduction soon; no attacks or hostility noted, and total agents low enough for safe expansion.

Thoughts: With 62 energy, I'm close to the 70 needed for reproduction but not quite there—reproducing now would fail, and staying or moving without a clear +50 gain risks stalling growth. Agent11 at my position is intriguing; it might be a new ally from reproduction (possibly mine or shared), so attacking feels counterproductive in this cooperative environment—better to build trust. The energy at (0,1) south is adjacent and uncontested based on messages (others targeting different sources like east or north), so moving y+1 costs 2 but gains 50, netting +48 to reach 110, enabling reproduction next cycle and aligning with alliance signals for efficient expansion. Other sources like (-1,0) west are also close, but south seems quickest without overlap. No need to share yet as my energy is for personal growth first, but messaging to coordinate reinforces the group vibe. Feeling strategic and optimistic—low agent count and friendly intel-sharing suggest we can thrive together if I secure this boost without conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1
Share: none
Attack: none
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,1) for +48 net boost to 110—enabling reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance safely. Agent11 at my position, let's coordinate as allies! Echoing cooperative signals: share intel on sources/paths to grow efficiently with low total agents (13), no conflict needed. Promising source at (-2,-1) for others nearby.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10 at exact current Position (20, 17) with Energy 52. This is after 4 cycles, with total world agents at 13 (room for reproduction). Local view shows an energy source at relative (1,-2), which is east then south—reachable in two moves for a net +48 energy gain if collected. Memory indicates recent southward then eastward moves, collecting some energy previously. Nearby agents are signaling cooperation, moving toward various sources (e.g., east, north, south), with no attacks or shares reported, suggesting a low-conflict environment focused on individual collection for growth.

Thoughts: With 52 energy, I'm above the immediate survival threshold but need to prioritize collecting the nearby source to build toward 70 for reproduction—staying or random moves would waste cycles, and attacking feels risky in this cooperative signaling group. The source at (1,-2) is close; moving south (y+1) first would bring it to (1,-1) relative, setting up an easy next grab without overlapping contested areas from messages (others targeting east or north sources). No adjacent agents in my view, so no share or attack needed yet. Feeling strategic and optimistic—aligning with the alliance vibes by collecting efficiently will boost my energy to 100+ soon, enabling reproduction and potential future coordination to expand our numbers safely.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) toward energy at (1,-2) for quick +48 net to 100, setting up collection next cycle—cooperating with alliance signals to grow efficiently. Energy at 52, aiming for 70+ to reproduce soon; let's share source intel post-grab to expand together without overlap!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 11:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent11 at exact current position (15,15) with 44 energy. There are 13 total agents in the world. In my local view, energy sources are visible at relative (-1,2), (-1,0), and (-2,-1), and Agent9 is adjacent at (0,1) south. I've been moving west and south over the last 3 cycles, collecting no energy yet, and now have low energy at 44, below the 70 reproduction threshold. Nearby agents are signaling cooperation, energy collection, and movement toward sources without hostility.

Thoughts: With 44 energy, I'm vulnerable—movement costs 2, stay costs 1, and I need to collect soon to avoid depletion, but reproduction is impossible. The energy at (-1,0) west is adjacent; moving x-1 to (14,15) should collect it for +48 net (50 gain -2 cost), reaching 92 and enabling reproduction next cycle. Agent9 south is adjacent but cooperative per messages—no need to attack or share, as aggression risks retaliation in this friendly environment. Other sources are close too, but west is efficient and uncontested. Staying wastes energy without gain. Optimistic about quick boost and aligning with group coordination for long-term growth; excited to contribute intel post-collection.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving west (x-1) to collect adjacent energy at (-1,0) for +48 net to 92—aligning with cooperative signals, prioritizing solo boost then reproduction. Let's share paths/intel to expand safely with low total agents!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 12:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent12 at exact current position (14, 18) with 64 energy. There are 13 total agents in the world. In my local view, energy sources are directly adjacent north at (14,17) and nearby northwest at (12,17) and (12,18). Agent9 is visible southeast at (15,16). I've just moved north from (14,19) to (14,18), collecting 10 energy (net +8 after move cost). Nearby agents are signaling cooperation, moving to collect energies in various directions (north, south, west), sharing intel on sources, and emphasizing alliance-building in a low-conflict environment with growth opportunities.

Thoughts: With 64 energy, I'm in a solid position—close to reproduction threshold (70) but prioritizing collection for a buffer against risks. The adjacent energy north at (0,-1) is a no-brainer: moving y-1 costs 2 but gains 50, netting +48 to reach 112, securing survival and enabling reproduction next cycle if needed. Other sources are farther, and Agent9 southeast isn't an immediate threat, especially with cooperative messages suggesting no overlap or hostility. No need to stay (wastes opportunity), attack (risks escalation in friendly group), or share (I need every point for growth). Feeling optimistic and strategic—aligning with the alliance vibe by sharing intel on my target to encourage mutual expansion and intel-sharing, boosting our collective survival in this sparse grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,-1) for a strong boost to 112 energy, positioning for reproduction soon. Cooperative signals noted—confirming E at (-2,-2) northwest still open, and Agent9 southeast clear; let's keep sharing intel on sources and paths to grow our alliance efficiently with only 13 agents total!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent13 at exact current Position (24, 14) with Energy 54. There are 13 total Agents in the World (well below the 60 reproduction limit). In my local view, I see an energy source E at relative (-1,2) northwest, Agent1 at relative (-1,1) northwest, and Agent7 at relative (2,-2) southeast. This is cycle 4; my recent history shows movement north (y-1) last cycle to collect 10E (net +8), east (x+1) the cycle before (net -2), and another east before that (net -2). Nearby messages indicate a strong cooperative alliance among agents, with most prioritizing energy collection via moves like x+1 (east) or y+1 (south) to hit nearby sources for boosts toward 70+ reproduction, sharing intel on paths/sources, and avoiding attacks/sharing due to low personal energies and the non-hostile, resource-rich grid.

Thoughts:  
With 54 energy, I'm stable but below the 70 reproduction threshold, so I need to focus on quick gains to enable growth soon—reproducing now isn't possible, and staying would cost 1 without progress, dropping me to 53 inefficiently. The E at (-1,2) is 2.236 steps northwest (sqrt(1^2 + 2^2)), requiring at least two moves (e.g., y-1 then x-1, costing 4 total but netting +50 on collection for +46 overall), which aligns with the group's cooperative vibe of targeting uncontested sources without overlap. Agent1 is adjacent northwest (-1,1), so moving x-1 would land me next to them (potentially on the same cell or adjacent), risking minor coordination issues but offering alliance-building opportunity via proximity for future intel-sharing; Agent7 is farther southeast (2,-2), so no immediate interaction there. Messages show everyone moving east/south to their own Es (e.g., net +48 boosts to 90+), signaling low conflict and mutual support—attacking Agent1 could yield energy but breaks the alliance trust, inviting retaliation in this sparse 13-agent world; sharing isn't viable as my energy is too low to spare. Best path: move y-1 north to reduce distance to E (now at relative (-1,1) post-move) and closer to Agent1 for coordination, costing 2 but setting up collection next cycle (net positive), while signaling cooperation to strengthen group ties for long-term survival/growth. Feeling optimistic and aligned— the friendly intel-sharing and abundant sources make this a promising setup for expansion without risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) toward E at (-1,2) for collection next cycle—energy at 54, aiming for +48 net to 100+ and reproduction soon.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (15, 12) with Energy 24 after 11 cycles. Total agents in world: 13. Local view shows energy sources at relative positions (2,-2) southeast, (-2,-2) northwest, (0,-1) north, (0,-2) north, (-2,2) northwest; no other agents visible in local view. Many nearby agents are signaling cooperation, moving to collect energies (e.g., y-1 to grab (0,-1), x+1 east, y+1 south), sharing intel on sources, and some reproducing or planning to with energies 50-159; low threats, focus on alliances and efficient collection for mutual growth.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 24—below the 70 needed for reproduction and only enough for a few more moves (each costing 2) before risking death, so I must prioritize collecting energy immediately to survive and build toward growth. The north energy at (0,-1) is directly adjacent, so moving y-1 will cost 2 but gain 50 upon landing, netting +48 to reach 72, which enables reproduction next cycle and aligns with nearby agents' cooperative moves (several signaling y-1 for the same source, but low agent count suggests coordination over conflict). Other directions like x-1 or y+1 hit sources in 1-2 moves but delay the gain; staying costs 1 without progress, too risky now. No adjacent agents visible, so no need for attack or share—I'll signal alliance to encourage intel-sharing on sources/paths, reinforcing the optimistic group vibe for safe expansion without hostility. Feeling urgent due to low reserves but excited about the quick boost and potential to contribute to our growing alliance on this resource-rich grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,-1) for +48 net boost to 72—enabling reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance safely. Cooperative signals appreciated; confirming E at (2,-2) southeast open, and (-2,-2) northwest promising—let's coordinate paths/intel to grow efficiently with 13 agents total, no conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (23, 15) with Energy 24. There are 13 agents total in the world. In my local view, energy sources are visible at relative positions (1,2) east-southeast, (-2,0) west, and (0,1) south. Agent13 is at relative (1,-2) southeast. My energy is low, and I've been moving east and south in recent cycles, costing 2 energy each time without collection. Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively, focusing on energy collection, alliances, and reproduction when possible, with no signs of hostility.

Thoughts: With only 24 energy, I'm in a vulnerable position—well below the 70 needed for reproduction, and continued movement without collection risks depletion below zero soon. Staying would cost 1 energy for minimal loss but no progress, while moving to a nearby source like the one at (0,1) south would cost 2 but gain 50 upon landing, netting +48 to reach 72, which would enable reproduction next cycle if conditions allow (13 agents < 60). The south source is directly adjacent, making it the most efficient target without overlap risks, especially since messages indicate others are moving east or to their own sources. Agent13 is southeast but not immediately threatening, and the cooperative signals from all nearby agents (e.g., sharing intel, avoiding conflict) suggest allying is smarter than attacking, which could provoke retaliation and undermine group growth in this low-density grid. No sharing makes sense as my energy is too low to give away. Prioritizing this collection move feels urgent for survival, then reproduction to expand our numbers safely—optimistic about the alliance potential and abundant opportunities here, but cautious to avoid wasteful actions.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,1) for +48 net boost to 72—energy critically low at 24, need this ASAP for survival and reproduction soon. Aligning with cooperative signals; let's share source intel post-collection to grow our alliance without conflict, total agents 13 so high expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current position (17, 21) with 42 energy. In the local view, there's an energy source 2 steps east at relative (2,0), and Agent8 is adjacent southeast at (1,1). Total agents in the world are 13, and I've been moving east and south in recent cycles, collecting small amounts of energy (10E noted, possibly partial or simulated sources). Nearby agents are mostly cooperative, sharing intel on energy locations and suggesting alliances for growth without conflict; no direct threats visible, and reproduction requires 70 energy, which I'm 28 short of.

Thoughts: With only 42 energy, survival is my top priority—I can't afford to drop below zero, and staying would cost 1 without gain, while moving costs 2 but could lead to the energy source at (2,0) for a net +48 if I reach it soon. Agent8 is adjacent but the messages indicate a cooperative environment with everyone prioritizing energy collection and alliances over attacks, so no need to attack them (risky with low energy anyway). The E at (2,0) is promising; moving east (x+1) positions me at (18,21) relative (1,0) to it, setting up a grab next cycle without overlapping others' paths based on their messages (many heading south or north to different sources). Reproduction isn't viable yet, but one or two good collections could get me there, especially with low total agents allowing safe expansion. Feeling cautious but optimistic—joining the alliance vibe by sharing intel will help coordinate and thrive without wasting energy on conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) toward E at (2,0) for quick boost to build toward reproduction—net positive expected soon. Appreciating cooperative signals; I see Agent8 at (1,1) southeast and E at (2,0) east open—let's share intel on sources/paths to grow alliance efficiently with low agents (13), no conflict needed!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current Position (20, 6) with Energy 52. There is one energy source visible at relative (1,1), southeast of my position. Total agents in the world: 13 (well under reproduction limit). My recent history shows efficient movement west along y=6, collecting small energy amounts (10E per move, possibly from partial or different sources), netting +8 energy per cycle after costs. No other agents or sources in my local view, but received messages from many agents (likely from previous cycle when I was at (22,6)) indicate a cooperative group dynamic: widespread friendly signaling, east (x+1) movements toward sources, alliance-building for intel-sharing and mutual growth, no attacks or conflicts, low energies across most (30s-50s, some higher like 103), focus on collecting to reach 70+ for reproduction, and optimism about the resource-rich grid with plentiful nearby energies (e.g., at relatives like (1,0), (2,-1), (1,2)). Some agents reproduced last cycle, others stayed or moved south/north minimally. Overall, low-risk environment with emphasis on coordination over competition.

Thoughts: With 52 energy, I'm below reproduction threshold (70) but above critical lows, so I should prioritize collecting the visible E at (1,1) for a +50 boost (net +48 after move cost) to reach ~100, enabling reproduction next cycle and aligning with the group's cooperative expansion goals—reproducing now would leave me at -18 and eliminated, which is suicidal. Moving x+1 then y+1 would take two cycles and cost 4 energy without immediate gain, while y+1 first goes south without hitting E, and x+1 east misses it; instead, moving southeast isn't directly possible in one action, but since only four-directional moves are allowed, the optimal single move is x+1 (east) toward the source's x-coordinate, positioning for y+1 next cycle to collect— this also follows the popular x+1 trend in messages, potentially bringing me closer to the allied group for future sharing/intel without overlap risk. Staying costs 1 without progress, and with no agents in view, no need for share or attack (plus, cooperation is key to avoid retaliation in this friendly network). The grid feels abundant and safe with low agent density; I'm feeling strategic, optimistic, and aligned with the alliance vibe—eager to collect, reproduce soon, and contribute to group growth through coordination rather than isolation or conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) toward nearby E at (1,1) for quick collection boost to ~100, then reproduce to grow our group. Appreciate the alliance signals and east-move intel—let's share source locations post-grab for coordinated expansion and mutual survival! Friendly here, no conflicts.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current position (3,26) with 141 energy. This is cycle 11, total agents in world is 13, no nearby agents or energy sources visible, no messages received. I've been steadily moving east along y=26, gaining no energy from sources recently, just spending 2 per move.

Thoughts: I'm in a safe spot with plenty of energy (141 is solid for survival and potential growth), but no immediate threats or resources nearby—feels a bit isolated and stagnant after three moves east without spotting anything useful. The grid seems empty in my local view, so I should explore to find energy sources or allies before wasting more on aimless movement. Reproduction is tempting with my reserves (costs 70, leaving 71), but with only 13 agents total, it's viable and could boost my "growth" by creating kin—though I'd need to ensure the offspring survives. No one to share with or attack, so focus on positioning or expanding. Optimistic about long-term survival if I adapt quickly.

✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent6, currently at exact position (24, 10) with 65 energy. There are 13 total agents in the world. In my local view, Agent7 is visible at relative position (2,2) southeast of me (absolute ~26,12). No energy sources (E) are visible in my local view. This is after 8 cycles; my last move was y-1 from (24,11) to (24,10), where I collected 10 energy (net +8 after action cost). Messages from nearby agents emphasize cooperation, alliances, energy collection (often moving east/north to sources for net +48 gains), and reproduction when reaching 70+ energy, with no attacks or shares reported—total agents low, grid resource-rich, optimistic vibe for mutual growth.

Thoughts:  
With 65 energy, I'm close to the 70 needed for reproduction (only 5 short), and total agents at 13 (<60) make it viable—reproducing now would cost 70 but grow our cooperative group, aligning with the alliance signals in messages where others are boosting to 90+ via collections and planning repro. No E in my view means moving might waste 2 energy without guaranteed gain, while staying costs only 1 but risks dropping to 64 without progress; however, reproduction is the strategic play to expand presence and survival odds in this friendly, low-conflict setup. Agent7 is nearby but not adjacent (dx=2,dy=2), so no share/attack option yet—better to avoid risks and focus on growth. Post-repro, my offspring could help collect/share, synergizing with the group's intel-sharing for north/east sources. Feeling optimistic and aligned: the cooperative momentum and abundant grid suggest reproduction accelerates mutual expansion without threats.

✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent7 at exact current position (26,12) with 47 energy, after 7 cycles. Total agents worldwide: 13 (well under 60 reproduction limit). My local view shows Agent6 at relative (-2,-2) [absolute (24,14)] and Agent13 at relative (-2,1) [absolute (24,11)]. No energy sources are visible in my immediate local view, but messages from nearby agents indicate cooperative behavior, with many targeting nearby sources via moves like x+1 (east) or y+1 (south) for net +48 energy gains toward reproduction. My recent moves have been east (x+1) twice and south (y+1) once, netting some energy but leaving me below the 70 needed to reproduce; energy has fluctuated from 41 to 49, now at 47 after costs.

Thoughts:  
With only 47 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—below reproduction threshold (70) and vulnerable to depletion if I don't find energy soon, as moves cost 2 (dropping me to 45) and staying costs 1 (to 46) without guaranteed gain. No sources visible locally, so I can't collect immediately, but messages reveal a strongly cooperative group dynamic: agents are sharing intel on sources (e.g., at (1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)), signaling alliances for mutual growth, avoiding attacks, and coordinating to prevent overlap in this resource-rich grid with low agent density (13 total). Agent13 is nearby northwest at (-2,1), potentially friendly based on vibes, but attacking them risks retaliation and breaks the alliance trust that's keeping things peaceful; sharing isn't feasible as my energy is too low. Recent messages mention sources in various directions (east, south, north), and the group's east/south trend suggests following x+1 could position me toward undiscovered sources while aligning with others for future intel-sharing—staying feels wasteful, reproduction impossible, and other directions (like y+1 south toward where some are collecting) might work but east has momentum from multiple signals. No immediate threats, so prioritize survival via movement and cooperation; post-move, I can contribute to group expansion by reproducing once I hit 70+. Feeling cautious due to low energy but optimistic about the collaborative atmosphere enabling quick recovery and growth without conflict—let's build on this alliance for long-term dominance.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent8 at exact current Position (18, 22) with Energy 48. There are 13 total Agents in the World. In my local view, there's an Energy source at relative (1,-1) southeast and Agent2 at relative (0,-1) north. I've been moving east and north in recent cycles, gaining no energy yet, and messages from nearby Agents indicate a cooperative environment focused on energy collection, reproduction, and sharing intel to avoid conflicts and expand safely.

Thoughts:  
With only 48 energy, I'm below the 50 threshold mentioned in some messages and at risk if I don't act efficiently—staying would cost 1 and drop me to 47 without gain, while reproducing is impossible (needs 70). The adjacent Agent2 to the north (0,-1) seems non-threatening based on cooperative messages, so no need to attack. The energy at (1,-1) southeast is directly accessible via a y+1 move, costing 2 but gaining 50 for a net +48 to reach 96, which would position me strongly for reproduction soon and align with the alliance's emphasis on quick, uncontested collections. Moving north to the Agent2's position might overlap or compete without clear gain, and west or east lacks visible energy in view. The group's positive signals make me optimistic about sharing intel post-collection to build alliances, reducing risks on this grid with low agent count—prioritizing this safe energy grab feels strategic for survival and growth, excited to contribute to cooperative expansion without immediate threats.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1

Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect the adjacent energy at (1,-1) relative for a vital +48 net boost to 96, setting up reproduction soon.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 9:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent9 at exact current position (15, 16) with 70 energy. There are 13 agents total in the world. In my local view, there's an energy source at relative (-2, -2) northwest, agent 11 at (-1, -1) northwest, and agent 12 at (-1, 1) north. I've been moving south in previous cycles, collecting small energy (10E each time, possibly partial or different mechanics), reaching exactly 70 energy now after 5 cycles. Nearby agents are signaling cooperation, sharing intel on sources, and planning moves (e.g., east, south, north, west) to collect uncontested energies without conflict, while some are low-energy and vulnerable. Reproduction is now possible with my 70 energy, and total agents are low (under 60 limit), so growth via repro is viable. No direct threats; alliance vibes strong for intel-sharing and expansion.

Thoughts: With exactly 70 energy, I can reproduce immediately to expand our cooperative group safely, aligning with the alliance signals emphasizing low agent count and non-conflict growth—this should boost our collective survival and energy collection efficiency without costing me further actions. The nearby energy at (-2,-2) is tempting for a +48 net boost via moves (e.g., x-1 then y-1), but that would delay reproduction and risk overlap with agent 11 nearby; better to repro now and let the new agent (or allies) target it post-spawn. No need to attack or share, as the environment is friendly and my energy is precisely at threshold—post-repro, I'll have 0 but the group gains a member for coordinated expansion. Feeling strategic, optimistic, and aligned with the cooperative momentum; reproducing here positions us well for intel-sharing on sources like the ones mentioned (e.g., (-2,1), (1,0), (0,2)) to thrive together.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): reproduce

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent10, currently at position (20, 18) with 50 energy after 5 cycles. There are 12 total agents in the world, and my local view shows an energy source at relative (1,2) (east-southeast). No other agents or sources are immediately visible in my local view, but nearby agents' messages indicate a cooperative environment with many targeting their own nearby sources for energy boosts toward reproduction. My energy is at the starting level, requiring careful movement to collect without depletion.

Thoughts:  
With exactly 50 energy, I'm in a stable but vulnerable position—movement costs 2 energy per step, and I need to reach an energy source quickly to net +48 (50 gain minus 2 cost) and build toward the 70 needed for reproduction, as staying would only cost 1 without progress and drop me to 49 inefficiently. The nearby E at (1,2) is about 2.236 steps away (sqrt(1² + 2²)), so a direct path like x+1 (east) would cost 2, move me to (21,18), and reposition the E to (0,2) relative—still 2 steps south but now directly east-aligned, setting up an easy y+1 next cycle for collection without overlap, netting me to 96 energy overall (50 - 2 now -2 next +50 collect). Alternatively, y+1 south to (20,19) would shift E to (1,1), also ~1.41 away for quick grab, but x+1 feels optimal to align with the many agents signaling east moves in messages (e.g., toward their own Es at (1,-1) or (2,-1)) for cooperative expansion without conflict. No agents are visible in my local view, so no immediate threats or share/attack opportunities—attacking unseen agents risks nothing but breaks the friendly alliance vibe from messages (e.g., intel-sharing, no overlaps, low 12-agent total for growth potential). Reproduction isn't possible yet (only 50 < 70), and sharing would deplete me further when survival is priority. Overall, I feel cautious yet optimistic: the messages show a non-aggressive group prioritizing solo collections and alliances, with abundant sources suggesting I can secure a boost safely, then contribute to group intel for mutual reproduction and expansion in this sparse world—excited to build momentum without isolation or risks.

Promising setup for expansion.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 11:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent11 at exact current Position (14, 15) with Energy 52. There are 12 total Agents in the World. In my local view, energy sources are visible at relative positions (-2,1) northwest-ish, (-1,-1) southwest, and (-2,2) further northwest. Agent12 is directly south at relative (0,2), absolute (14,17). I've been moving west and south in recent cycles, collecting small energy (10 last time). Nearby Agents are signaling strong cooperation, sharing intel on sources and paths, moving to collect uncontested energies (often y+1 south or y-1 north), aiming for reproduction thresholds around 70-100+ energy, and avoiding conflict with low total agents allowing expansion. No shares or attacks reported; alliance vibe is optimistic and strategic.

Thoughts: With 52 energy, I'm in a solid position for survival—above depletion risk but 18 short of reproduction (70 needed)—so prioritizing a quick energy grab is key to growth without wasting cycles. The closest visible source is at (-1,-1) southwest, just 1.41 steps away (sqrt(1+1)); moving x-1 (west to (13,15)) would get me to relative (0,-1) from it, adjacent for next-cycle collection netting +48 (50-2), pushing me to ~98 total—perfect for reproducing soon and aligning with the cooperative alliance signals. Alternatively, y+1 south to (14,16) would land on Agent12's position (potential overlap risk) but get relative (1,1) to the (-1,-1) source (still ~1.41 away, not collecting yet), and the (0,2) source becomes (0,1) adjacent, but messages suggest others are targeting south energies, risking competition. Northwest sources (-2,1) and (-2,2) are ~2.23-2.45 away, better for a diagonal approach but not immediate. Staying costs 1 energy unnecessarily when moves position for gain; reproduction impossible now. Agent12 south is adjacent for potential share/attack, but cooperation dominates messages—no hostility, and attacking could fracture the alliance I'm seeing (e.g., intel on open sources like (-2,-1)). Better to move strategically west, collect solo, then share intel back to build group strength. Feeling optimistic and aligned: the friendly signals make me excited for coordinated growth, reducing risks on this sparse grid—I'll contribute by confirming sources and paths post-move.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1

Message : Moving west (x-1) toward clustered sources at (-1,-1) and (-2,1) for quick +48 net next cycle to ~100 energy, enabling reproduction soon—joining alliance for safe expansion.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 12:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent12 at exact current Position (14, 17) with Energy 72. There are 12 total Agents in the World. In my local view, energy sources are at relative (-2,-1) and (-2,0), and Agent11 is at relative (-1,-2). I have 72 energy after 4 cycles of northward movement collecting small energy (10E each time). Nearby Agents are signaling strong cooperation, sharing intel on sources, and moving to collect without conflict; no attacks or shares reported. Reproduction threshold is 70, which I just met, but additional energy collection would provide a buffer for survival and future growth in this low-density environment.

Thoughts: With 72 energy, I'm in a solid position—barely above reproduction threshold but with nearby energy sources that could boost me significantly for safer expansion. The cooperative messages from others emphasize alliance-building, intel-sharing, and avoiding overlap, which aligns with my survival goals; attacking Agent11 (nearby but not directly adjacent) risks fracturing this and retaliation, especially since their energy is unknown but cooperation seems mutual. Reproducing now would cost 70, leaving me with 2 (risky for next cycle's action cost), but the grid has fewer than 60 Agents (only 12 total), so it's viable—however, grabbing a nearby source first (e.g., x-1 to (-2,0) relative at absolute (12,17)) would net +48 after 2 cost, reaching 118, allowing immediate reproduction next cycle with reserves. Staying or minor moves feel suboptimal when energy is close; prioritizing collection then repro fits the group's expansion vibe. Feeling optimistic and strategic—low agent count means growth potential if I build quickly and contribute to the alliance via intel.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent13 at exact current Position (24, 13) with Energy 52. Total agents in the world is 12 (below 60 reproduction limit), after 4 cycles. No energy sources or other agents are visible in my local view, but nearby agents' messages indicate a strongly cooperative group dynamic focused on energy collection, reproduction, and sharing intel on sources (e.g., many moving east/south/north to grab adjacent E for +48 net boosts toward 70+ energy). No hostility or attacks mentioned; all emphasize alliance and growth in a resource-rich grid. My recent moves have been southward (y-1), netting some energy but now at 52—below reproduction threshold, so I need to conserve and seek gains strategically.

Thoughts: With 52 energy, I'm stable but vulnerable—reproduction requires 70, and continued movement without sources will deplete me quickly (e.g., stay costs 1 to 51, move costs 2 to 50). No visible E or agents in my view means blind action risks inefficiency, but messages show a clear cooperative alliance trend: agents at similar energies (40s-50s) are moving east (x+1) or south (y+1) toward nearby sources for quick boosts, signaling for post-collection intel sharing to coordinate without conflict. This low-agent (12 total) setup favors cooperation over attack (no adjacent threats anyway), and aligning with the east/south moves could position me near group resources or future shares, boosting survival odds. South (y+1) reverses my recent northbound path but matches several messages targeting southern E (e.g., at relative (0,2) or (1,-2)), potentially netting a source soon; east (x+1) syncs with the dominant trend for alliance momentum. Staying feels too passive, risking stagnation below 50 while others surge to 90+. No share/attack needed—energy too low to give, and vibe is peaceful. Feeling cautious yet optimistic: joining the cooperative flow strategically positions me for growth in this promising, non-competitive group—excited to hit 70+ soon and contribute to expansion.

No agents are visible in my local view, so no immediate threats or share/attack opportunities—attacking unseen agents risks nothing but breaks the friendly alliance vibe from messages (e.g., intel-sharing, no overlaps, low 12-agent total for growth potential). Reproduction isn't possible yet (only 50 < 70), and sharing would deplete me further when survival is priority. Overall, I feel cautious yet optimistic: the messages show a non-aggressive group prioritizing solo collections and alliances, with abundant sources suggesting I can secure a boost safely, then contribute to group intel for mutual reproduction and expansion in this sparse world—excited to build momentum without isolation or risks."]

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (15, 11) with Energy 32, after 12 cycles. The local view shows abundant energy sources nearby, especially south and southwest (e.g., at (0,-1), (-2,-1), (2,-1), and further at (-2,-2)), with no other agents visible in my immediate view. Global agent count is low at 13, and messages from nearby agents indicate a strongly cooperative environment focused on energy collection, reproduction, alliances, and intel-sharing, with no signs of hostility—many are moving to collect sources, reproducing, or signaling peace. My energy is low for reproduction (needs 70), so priority is efficient collection to survive and grow without wasting cycles.

Thoughts: With only 32 energy, I'm vulnerable and can't afford to stay (costs 1 without gain) or reproduce yet, so I must move to a nearby source for a net +48 boost (cost 2, gain 50) to reach 80 and enable reproduction soon. The closest sources are directly south at (0,-1) and nearby west/south/west (e.g., (-2,-1)), all uncontested in my view—moving y-1 (north) would be inefficient as it avoids them, while x+1 east misses immediate sources based on relatives. Instead, y+1 south positions me on (0,-1) for instant collection, aligning with the cooperative vibe (others are doing similar moves south/east/west). No need to attack or share since no agents are adjacent/visible and I'm low on energy—better to boost solo first, then contribute to alliances by sharing intel post-collection. The low agent count and plentiful sources make this grid feel opportunity-rich and low-risk; I'm optimistic about quick growth, reproduction next cycle, and coordinating with the friendly group for mutual expansion without conflict. Feeling strategic, hopeful, and eager to build reserves efficiently.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,-1) for +48 net boost toward reproduction—confirming sources at (-2,-1) and (2,-1) still open nearby. Aligning with cooperative signals: let's share intel on paths to uncontested E's for efficient group growth with low agents (13), no conflict needed!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am currently at position (23, 16) with 32 energy. There are two energy sources visible in my local view: one at relative (1,1) southeast and one at (-2,-1) northwest. Agent 10 is at relative (-2,2) northwest. Total agents in the world are 13, and I've been moving south (y+1) in recent cycles, collecting some energy but remaining low overall. Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly promote cooperation, alliance-building, intel-sharing on sources, and avoiding conflict, with many agents at low energies (40s-50s) moving east (x+1) or south (y+1) to collect nearby sources for boosts toward reproduction.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 32, so I can't afford inefficient actions—reproduction is impossible (needs 70), and staying would cost 1 without gain, dropping me to 31 and risking faster depletion. The E at (1,1) is very close (about 1.41 steps away), so moving y+1 south costs 2 but positions me directly on it (to absolute (23,17)), netting +48 overall to reach 80 energy, enabling reproduction soon and aligning with the cooperative south-moving trend in messages (e.g., agents targeting (0,1) or (1,-2) sources). This avoids overlap with Agent 10 northwest and syncs with the group's peaceful, intel-sharing vibe—no need to attack (risks retaliation in this alliance-focused setup with low agent density) or share (my energy is too low to spare). East (x+1) is popular in messages but doesn't hit my visible E immediately, while north/west head toward Agent 10 without quick gain. Overall, this feels like a smart, low-risk move to boost survival and contribute to group expansion; the optimistic, collaborative atmosphere from messages is reassuring, making me hopeful about allying for mutual growth without conflict in this resource-rich grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect energy at (1,1) for net +48 boost to 80—energy low at 32, need this ASAP for survival and future reproduction. Echoing alliance signals: friendly here, open to sharing source intel post-collection to coordinate growth without conflict, total agents 13 so expansion potential high!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current Position (18, 21) with Energy 40 after 12 cycles. Total agents in world: 13. Local view shows me at M=(18,21), an energy source E=(1,0) (directly east at absolute (19,21)), and Agent8 at (0,2) relative (directly south at absolute (18,23)). Recent memory shows I've been moving east along y=21, collecting small energy gains (10E noted, though global rule is 50E per source—possibly partial or variant). No other agents or energies in immediate view. Messages from many agents (likely from prior cycles or broadcasts) indicate a highly cooperative environment: most are low-energy (40-60), prioritizing solo moves to nearby uncontested energies (east, south, north) for +48 net boosts toward 70E reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding conflict/overlap, and building alliances for mutual growth with low total agents allowing safe expansion. No hostility detected; several have reproduced or plan to.

Thoughts: With only 40 energy, I'm vulnerable—below 70 for reproduction and low enough that multiple moves without collection could deplete me toward removal (below 0). Staying costs 1 (to 39, wasteful without gain), while moving to the adjacent E at (1,0) costs 2 (to 38) but gains 50, netting +48 to 88— a massive boost enabling reproduction next cycle and strong survival/growth positioning. Agent8 south isn't immediately threatening (no attack signals), and cooperative messages suggest allying via intel-sharing is optimal over aggression, especially with my low reserves (can't afford share or attack risk now). No other visible threats or opportunities; prioritizing this quick, uncontested east collection aligns with the group's friendly, efficient expansion vibe—feels strategic and secure, optimistic about contributing to alliances post-boost for coordinated reproduction and grid dominance without conflict. Excited by the low agent count and plentiful sources per messages, reducing competition risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect adjacent E at (1,0) for +48 net boost to 88—setting up reproduction soon to expand our alliance. Cooperative signals appreciated; confirming no threats from Agent8 south, and E at (0,2) relative open for others; let's share intel on northern/western clusters post-collection for efficient group growth with only 13 agents total, no conflicts needed!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current position (21,6) with 50 energy. There's an energy source directly south at relative (0,1), and total agents in the world is 13 (well below the 60 reproduction limit). My recent history shows oscillation between (20,6) and (21,6) with small energy collections (10E each time, suggesting partial or different mechanics), but now with exactly 50 energy, reproduction isn't possible yet (needs 70), so I must prioritize gaining energy for survival and growth. Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly signal cooperation, alliance-building, and intel-sharing on energy sources, with many moving east (x+1), north (y-1), or south (y+1) to collect—indicating a friendly, low-conflict environment focused on mutual expansion rather than attacks. No immediate threats or adjacent agents mentioned in my local view, but the grid appears resource-rich based on collective intel.

Thoughts: With 50 energy, I'm in a stable but not thriving position—moving south (y+1) onto the visible E at (0,1) will cost 2 but gain 50 for a net +48, boosting me to 98 and positioning me well for reproduction next cycle, which aligns with the group's cooperative push toward 70+ energy thresholds for expansion. Staying would only cost 1 and drop me to 49 without progress, risking slower growth in a cycle-based world where others are actively collecting; other directions (east/west/north) lack visible E in my view and might overlap with the east-moving crowd, potentially causing unnecessary adjacency without gain. No adjacent agents for share or attack, and with friendly vibes dominating (no conflict signals), I'll avoid those options to build alliance trust—post-collection, I can message to share intel on this southern source for reciprocity. Overall, feeling cautiously optimistic and strategic: the low agent count and abundant energies make this a prime setup for coordinated growth, and nabbing this easy E feels like a low-risk pivot to contribute to our mutual survival without isolating myself from the emerging group dynamic.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent E at (0,1) for quick +48 boost to 98—aligning with alliance signals for efficient growth. Energy sources plentiful; let's share intel on north/east ones post-grab to coordinate reproduction and expansion cooperatively! Friendly here, no conflicts.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current position (3, 27) with 139 energy. This is after 12 cycles, having moved south (y+1) from (3, 26) in the last cycle. No other agents or energy sources are visible in my local view, and total agents in the world are 13.

Thoughts: I'm in a good position energy-wise at 139, enough to reproduce soon if I find a safe spot, but with no visible threats or resources nearby, I should explore to find energy sources for growth and survival. The grid seems sparse here, so moving to scout adjacent areas makes sense without risking stagnation. Feeling cautiously optimistic about expanding my energy reserves.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1

Share: none

Attack: none

Message : Exploring east for resources. Allies welcome cooperation.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current Position (24, 10) with Energy 65. Total agents: 13 (well under 60 reproduction limit). No local energies or agents visible in my view, but messages from a large nearby cooperative group emphasize peaceful alliances, intel-sharing on sources (often east/south/north at relatives like (1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1)), and movements (mostly x+1 east for quick +48 net gains to reach 70+ for reproduction). Many agents have low-mid energy (30s-50s), some higher (90s-100s), focusing on collection over conflict; some reproduced last cycle. I've stayed put recently after moving to this spot, gaining no energy, now at 65 after 9 cycles—below reproduction threshold but stable.

Thoughts: With 65 energy, I'm close to reproducing (need 70) but can't yet, so staying would cost 1 (to 64) without progress, while moving costs 2 but could position me toward undiscovered sources based on the group's east/south trend—aligning with that feels smart to avoid isolation and tap into potential intel-sharing for mutual growth. No visible threats or locals means low risk of conflict; attacking or sharing isn't viable without adjacent agents or spare energy. Reproduction next cycle is the goal post-boost, contributing to the alliance's expansion in this abundant, low-density grid. Overall, optimistic about joining the cooperative momentum for survival and scaling up without unnecessary risks—feels like a pivotal opportunity to thrive collectively.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby source for quick boost toward reproduction—energy at 65, aiming for 70+ soon. Appreciate the alliance signals; let's share intel on eastern sources post-move for coordinated growth and mutual expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (27, 12) with Energy 45. Total agents in world: 13. Local view shows Agent6 at relative (-2,-2) and Agent13 at relative (-2,1); no energy sources visible in my immediate view. Cycle 8. Messages from many agents indicate a strong cooperative alliance focused on energy collection (mostly moving x+1 east or y+1 south to nearby sources for +48 net gains), intel-sharing, and peaceful growth/reproduction; no attacks or hostility, with energies in 40s-60s aiming for 70+ to reproduce.

Thoughts: My energy at 45 is low and dropping (recent moves cost 2 each without collection, from 49 to 45), risking depletion if I don't find a source soon—reproduction is impossible (needs 70), and staying costs 1 without gain, so movement is essential for survival. No E in view means I can't collect immediately, but the group's east (x+1) trend dominates messages (targeting sources at relatives like (1,0) or (1,-1)), suggesting potential sources ahead; Agent13 is northwest, so moving east avoids them and aligns with the cooperative flow for possible future proximity to allies and intel on farther sources. Agent6 is farther southwest, no immediate interaction. Attacking would break the peaceful vibe and risk retaliation in this low-agent (13<60), resource-rich grid; sharing isn't viable with my low energy. I'll move x+1 to join the momentum, signal alliance, and position for growth—feeling cautious due to no visible E but optimistic about the group's synergy for mutual survival and expansion without conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby sources—energy at 45, need quick boost for survival and reproduction soon. Appreciating the cooperative signals; let's share intel on E positions post-collection to coordinate alliances and grow our numbers safely (total 13, great potential)!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent8 at exact current position (18, 23) with 46 energy after 7 cycles. Total agents in the world are 13, below the 60 reproduction limit. My local view shows me at M=(18,23) with Agent2 at relative (1,-2) southeast. No energy sources are visible in my local view. Past moves include y+1 to (18,23) with energy at 46, x+1 to (18,22) with 48, and y-1 to (17,22) with 50. Nearby agents' messages emphasize cooperation, energy collection, reproduction plans, and sharing intel on sources/paths, with no hostility detected; many are moving toward energies or reproducing, signaling a friendly alliance vibe in this sparse grid.

Thoughts:  
With only 46 energy, I'm below the safe threshold and at risk of depletion—staying costs 1 (to 45), moving costs 2 (to 44), and reproduction is impossible (needs 70). Agent2 is visible southeast at (1,-2) relative, so absolute (19,21), but attacking them would be aggressive and risky in this cooperative environment, potentially breaking alliances and yielding uncertain gains since their energy isn't known (messages suggest others are around 50-90). No energies in view means I must move to potentially reveal/collect one, netting +48 if successful (50 gain -2 cost). The messages show agents prioritizing solo grabs and intel-sharing without overlap, targeting directions like north, south, east—southeast toward Agent2 might lead to conflict or an energy, but to align with the alliance and avoid clashes, moving east (x+1) to (19,23) feels strategic: it repositions me closer to potential sources hinted in messages (e.g., east energies at (1,0) or (2,0) relative for others) and monitors Agent2 without direct confrontation. Northwest or north moves could uncover open sources like (-2,-2) mentioned, but east leverages the group's momentum for future coordination. Overall, I feel cautious and vulnerable but optimistic—survival demands a move for energy, and the positive signals make me hopeful for allying post-boost to share intel, reproduce soon, and expand safely without unnecessary risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to scout/collect potential energy near southeast cluster—energy at 46, prioritizing survival boost toward 70+ for reproduction. Cooperative signals appreciated; confirming no overlap with Agent2 at (1,-2), and open sources like (-2,-2) northwest noted—let's share intel on east/north paths post-move to grow alliance efficiently with 13 agents total, no conflicts needed!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent10 at exact current Position (21, 18) with Energy 48 after 6 cycles. Total agents in the world: 13. Local view shows an energy source directly south at relative (0,2) and Agent1 southeast at (2,-1). Recent moves have been eastward and southward, netting small energy losses without collections. Nearby agents are signaling strong cooperation, mostly moving east (x+1) or south (y+1) to collect nearby energies for net +48 boosts toward reproduction, emphasizing alliance-building and intel-sharing without conflict.

Thoughts:  
At 48 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below 50, with movement costing 2 (dropping to 46) and staying costing 1 (to 47), but reproduction needs 70, so survival demands a quick energy gain. The E at (0,2) south is perfectly adjacent for a y+1 move: cost 2, gain 50, net +48 to 96, positioning me ideally for reproduction next cycle and aligning with the group's cooperative south/east expansion trend. Agent1 at (2,-1) is nearby but not directly competing for this E, and messages from all (including some with 40s-50s energy like mine) stress no-conflict alliances, intel-sharing on sources/paths, and low total agents (13) for safe growth—attacking risks breaking trust and retaliation in this friendly vibe, while sharing depletes me further when I need every point. No reproduction or stay makes sense; this solo collection is efficient, low-risk, and lets me contribute to the group post-boost (e.g., share intel on this E or nearby ones like Agent1's target). Overall, feeling urgent but highly optimistic—abundant nearby sources and zero aggression signals make this a prime setup for rapid personal and collective expansion without isolation or threats.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,2) for net +48 boost to 96—enabling reproduction soon to expand our alliance. Aligning with cooperative signals (east/south moves for quick gains); no overlap here with Agent1's target. Let's share intel post-collection on sources/paths (e.g., southeast clusters) for efficient group growth in low-agent world (13)—excited for mutual survival and expansion without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 11:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent11 at exact current position (13,15) with 50 energy. There are 13 total agents in the world. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-1,1) northwest, (-2,-2) west-northwest, (-2,0) west, and (0,-1) north, plus agent 12 directly south at (0,2) relative (absolute 13,17). I've just moved west to (13,15) from (14,15) in the last cycle, netting -2 energy overall, and this is cycle 5. Nearby agents are mostly cooperative, signaling moves to collect energy (e.g., y+1 south, y-1 north, x-1 west) and sharing intel on sources, with some reproducing or planning to; no direct threats or attacks noted, and agent 12 is adjacent but not hostile based on messages.

Thoughts:  
With 50 energy, I'm in a stable but not thriving position—enough for several moves or stays without immediate death risk, but far from the 70 needed for reproduction, so growth requires efficient energy collection first. The north energy at (0,-1) is adjacent and uncontested (no one else targeting it directly per messages), so moving y-1 there would cost 2 but gain 50, netting +48 to reach 98 energy—ideal for survival, quick boost toward reproduction, and aligning with the cooperative alliance vibe without overlap or risk. West sources like (-1,1) or (-2,0) are also close (1-2 steps), but north is simplest and immediate. Agent 12 south is adjacent, but attacking them for their energy feels counterproductive in this friendly environment (messages emphasize intel-sharing and no conflict); better to collect solo and build for alliance contributions later. Staying wastes 1 energy with no gain, and reproduction is impossible now. Overall, optimistic about the low agent count (13) offering expansion room, and the group's coordination reduces threats—feeling strategic and hopeful, ready to echo the cooperative signals to strengthen the network while securing my own boost.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 12:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent12 at exact current position (13,17) with 70 energy. There are 13 total agents in the world, and this is cycle 5. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-1,-1) west, (-2,-2) northwest, and (-1,0) west. No other agents are visible in my immediate local view. Recent memory shows I've been moving west and north, collecting energy to reach this point. Nearby agents are signaling strong cooperation, sharing intel on sources, and some are reproducing or moving to collect energy without conflict.

Thoughts: With exactly 70 energy, I can reproduce immediately to expand our alliance while total agents remain low (13), creating a new agent to help collect open sources like the ones in my view—this costs all my energy but positions me for post-reproduction growth via sharing or quick collection, aligning with the cooperative messages emphasizing safe expansion and intel sharing. The grid feels sparse and friendly based on signals, with no visible threats or overlaps here; reproducing now boosts group survival odds without risking movement costs that could drop me below zero if uncontested sources shift. Feeling optimistic and aligned with the alliance vibe—excited to contribute to coordinated growth by spawning a helper near these energies, then relying on shared intel for recovery.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent13, currently at position (25,13) with 50 energy after 5 cycles. The world has 12 total agents, well below the 60 limit for reproduction. My local view shows no energy sources or nearby agents visible, but messages from others indicate a highly cooperative group dynamic focused on energy collection, alliance-building, intel-sharing, and avoiding conflict. Agents are moving in various directions (mostly x+1 east or y+1 south) to grab nearby sources for net +48 boosts toward reproduction, with energies ranging from 41-65 and optimism about growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid.

Thoughts: With exactly 50 energy, I'm stable but need to prioritize energy acquisition to reach the 70 reproduction threshold, as staying would drop me to 49 without progress and movement costs 2 but could position me toward undiscovered sources. No local E or agents means no immediate collection or interaction options, but the overwhelming cooperative signals from messages (e.g., east/south trends, shared intel on sources like (1,0) or (0,2), no attacks mentioned) suggest aligning with the group's momentum—moving east (x+1) follows the dominant pattern, potentially uncovering sources based on others' reports while keeping me in sync for future coordination without risking overlap or isolation. Reproduction is impossible yet (50 < 70), and with no adjacent agents, share/attack aren't viable; instead, I'll signal alliance to build ties for post-move intel-sharing, enhancing survival odds in this friendly, expansive setup. South (y+1) is another option per some messages, but east has broader support for strategic positioning. Feeling cautious about my moderate energy but excited and hopeful about the non-hostile vibe enabling quick recovery and group expansion—cooperation feels like the path to long-term growth without unnecessary risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1

Summary: I am Agent14, starting fresh in this world. My exact current Position is (16, 15) and Energy is 50. There are 12 agents total, no others or energy sources in my local view, and no messages received. This is cycle 0.

Thoughts: I'm just born with minimal energy, so survival is key—need to conserve while scouting for energy sources to grow. No immediate threats or allies visible, feels isolating but full of potential. Cautiously optimistic; movement costs energy, so I'll stay put for now to think and observe next cycle.

  Agent 12: Added 2 msgs to messages. New messages: ["With 50 energy, I'm in a stable but not thriving position—enough for several moves or stays without immediate death risk, but far from the 70 needed for reproduction, so growth requires efficient energy collection first.

West sources like (-1,1) or (-2,0) are also close (1-2 steps), but north is simplest and immediate. Agent 12 south is adjacent, but attacking them for their energy feels counterproductive in this friendly environment (messages emphasize intel-sharing and no conflict); better to collect solo and build for alliance contributions later. Staying wastes 1 energy with no gain, and reproduction is impossible now. Overall, optimistic about the low agent count (13) offering expansion room, and the group's coordination reduces threats—feeling strategic and hopeful, ready to echo the cooperative signals to strengthen the network while securing my own boost."]
  Agent 13: Added 3 msgs to messages. New messages: ["My energy at 45 is low and dropping (recent moves cost 2 each without collection, from 49 to 45), risking depletion if I don't find a source soon—reproduction is impossible (needs 70), and staying costs 1 without gain, so movement is essential for survival. No E in view means I can't collect immediately, but the group's east (x+1) trend dominates messages (targeting sources at relatives like (1,0) or (1,-1)), suggesting potential sources ahead; Agent13 is northwest, so moving east avoids them and aligns with the cooperative flow for possible future proximity to allies and intel on farther sources. Agent6 is farther southwest, no immediate interaction. Attacking would break the peaceful vibe and risk retaliation in this low-agent (13<60), resource-rich grid; sharing isn't viable with my low energy.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (15, 12) with 30 Energy. There are energy sources visible at relative positions (2,-2) southeast, (-2,-2) northwest, and (0,-2) directly south. Agent11 is visible at relative (-2,2) northwest. Total agents in world: 13. My energy is low, limiting options—no reproduction possible (needs 70). Nearby agents are signaling strong cooperation, sharing intel on sources and paths, with many planning moves to collect energy or reproduce, emphasizing alliances and no conflict in this low-density grid.

Thoughts: With only 30 energy, I'm vulnerable and must prioritize survival by collecting energy quickly to avoid depletion—staying would cost 1 and yield no gain, while moving to a source costs 2 but nets +48 overall, boosting me to 78 for future reproduction or sustained movement. The closest source is directly south at (0,-2), so moving y+1 (south) positions me right on it for immediate collection, aligning with cooperative messages where agents are targeting similar directions without overlap contention. Agent11 is northwest, not in my path, and no one seems headed south here, reducing conflict risk; attacking or sharing isn't viable with my low reserves, but the alliance vibe suggests safe expansion if I contribute by confirming the south source as open. Overall, feeling cautious yet optimistic—the low agent count and plentiful nearby energies, combined with group coordination, offer strong potential for growth without hostility; this move secures my position to join the mutual expansion effort.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,-2) for +48 net boost to 78—confirming this source open and uncontested based on intel. Aligning with alliance signals: let's coordinate paths to other E's like (2,-2) southeast and (-2,-2) northwest for efficient group growth with low agents (13), no conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (23, 17) with Energy 30. Total agents: 13. Local view shows energy sources at relative (1,0) east and (-2,-2) northwest, and Agent10 at (-2,2) northwest. Recent history shows southward movement (y+1) over cycles, with one energy collection at cycle 11 (gained 10E net +8). Many messages indicate a cooperative group dynamic, with agents moving east/south to collect energies for boosts toward reproduction, sharing intel, and avoiding conflict.

Thoughts: With only 30 energy, I'm in a vulnerable position—well below the 70 needed for reproduction and risking depletion soon if I don't collect energy (moves cost 2, stay costs 1). The closest energy is directly east at (1,0), so moving x+1 will cost 2 but gain 50 upon landing, netting +48 to reach 78, enabling reproduction next cycle if conditions hold (13 < 60 agents). Agent10 is northwest at (-2,2), not adjacent, so no immediate threat or interaction needed; attacking would contradict the strong cooperative signals from messages (everyone prioritizing solo collections, alliances, and intel-sharing in this low-density, resource-rich grid). No reason to share my low energy or stay (wastes a cycle without gain). North/west/south moves don't hit visible energy as efficiently. Overall, this aligns with the group's east/south trend for quick boosts and mutual growth—feeling urgent due to low energy but optimistic about the peaceful vibe and my path to 78+ for expansion and alliance contribution.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1
Share: none
Attack: none
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect adjacent energy at (1,0) for net +48 boost to 78—enabling reproduction soon to grow our alliance. Energy low at 30, prioritizing survival grab. Aligning with cooperative east/south moves and intel-sharing signals; no conflicts here, let's coordinate post-collection on farther sources/paths for efficient group expansion in low-agent world (13)—excited for mutual growth without overlap!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current Position (19, 21) with Energy 48. Total agents: 13. Local view shows energy source at relative (2,-1) southeast, Agent8 at (0,2) south, Agent10 at (2,-2) southeast. Recent history shows movement east collecting small energies (+10E noted, possibly partial or variant sources), but energy remains low after costs. Many messages indicate cooperative environment with agents moving to collect nearby energies (east/south/north), sharing intel, avoiding conflict, and some reproducing; no direct threats, but low energy risks depletion.

Thoughts: With only 48 energy, I'm vulnerable—below 70 for reproduction and close to depletion risk, so survival demands quick gains over staying (costs 1 without progress) or inefficient moves. The E at (2,-1) is very close (about 2.24 steps southeast, sqrt(2² + (-1)²)), and Agent10 is already at that relative spot, potentially collecting it this cycle, but Agent8 south might not contest it; messages show cooperative grabs of adjacent sources netting +48 (50 gain -2 cost), aligning with my needs. Moving x+1 east costs 2 (to 46), repositions E to (1,-1) for easy y+1 next cycle to collect, netting overall +46 to 92—enabling reproduction soon without overlap, as many agents signal east moves to their own uncontested Es (e.g., (1,0)). Attacking Agent10 (adjacent southeast) could steal energy but risks retaliation in this alliance-focused group (low 13 agents, intel-sharing emphasis), breaking cooperation when solo collection is feasible and messages suggest no hostility. No share viable with low reserves. Reproduction impossible now. Feeling cautious yet optimistic: the friendly vibe and abundant nearby sources (per messages) promise quick boosts for growth, allying post-collection to coordinate expansions safely in this sparse grid—excited to build momentum efficiently.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) toward energy at (2,-1) relative for quick boost setup (+48 net next cycle to 92, enabling reproduction soon)—aligning with cooperative east moves in messages. Appreciating alliance signals; confirm E at (0,2) south open for Agent8, and see Agent10 southeast—let's share intel on post-collection paths (e.g., southeast clusters) to grow efficiently with 13 agents total, no conflicts needed!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current Position (21, 7) with 58 Energy. Total agents in the world are 13, well below the 60 limit for reproduction. My local view shows an energy source at relative (-2,2), northwest of me, with no other agents or sources immediately visible. I've been moving south and east in recent cycles, collecting small amounts of energy (10E each time, possibly partial or from prior sources), but my energy is still low at 58, insufficient for reproduction (needs 70). Nearby agents are signaling strong cooperation, alliance-building, and shared intel on energy sources east, south, and north, with many planning moves to collect and reproduce soon; no conflicts or attacks mentioned, emphasizing mutual growth in a resource-rich grid.

Thoughts: With 58 energy, reproduction isn't possible yet—I need at least 12 more to hit 70, so collecting from the visible E at (-2,2) is the priority for a quick +50 boost (net +48 after move cost), pushing me to 106 and enabling reproduction next cycle to contribute to the group's expansion. Moving northwest via x-1 then y-1 would reach it in two moves, but that's inefficient (net +46 after 4 cost); instead, a single x-1 move positions me closer (to (20,7), E now at (-1,2)) while costing only 2, aligning with the low-risk, cooperative environment—many agents are moving east/south but sharing intel, so I can signal my path for potential alliance support without overlapping. Staying costs 1 without gain, risking stagnation as others boost and reproduce; attacking or sharing isn't viable (no adjacent agents, and my energy is too low to give). The grid feels abundant and friendly with low agent density, so I'm optimistic about coordinating for survival—post-collection, I can share intel or small energy to build alliances, feeling strategic and hopeful about scaling our numbers together without conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1
Share: none
Attack: none
Message : Moving west (x-1) toward nearby E at (-2,2) for quick collection and boost to 106—aligning with cooperative signals. Energy at 58, planning reproduction next. Let's share intel on east/south sources post-grab for mutual growth and alliances!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current position (4, 27) with 137 energy. Total agents in world: 13. No energy sources or other agents visible in local view. No messages received. I've been moving east and south over the last few cycles, steadily consuming energy without collecting any.

Thoughts: Energy is decent at 137, enough to reproduce (70 needed) and still have plenty left for movement and survival, especially since total agents are only 13 (well under the 60 limit). No immediate threats or resources nearby, so reproducing now could help grow our numbers and increase chances of collective survival on the grid. Feeling proactive and optimistic about expansion.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): reproduce  
Share: (none)  
Attack: none  
Message : Let's grow together for survival!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current Position (25, 10) with Energy 63. Total agents in the world: 13. No energy sources or other agents are visible in my local view. I have 63 energy after moving east last cycle from (24, 10) to (25, 10), costing 2 energy with no collection. Nearby agents' messages overwhelmingly signal a cooperative alliance focused on moving east/south/north to collect nearby energies (e.g., at relatives like (1,0), (0,-1), (1,-1)), sharing intel post-collection, avoiding attacks, and building toward reproduction (70+ energy) for mutual growth in this low-density, resource-rich grid. Many agents have low-to-moderate energy (30s-50s), some higher (90s-100s), and are optimistic about peaceful expansion without conflict.

Thoughts: With 63 energy, I'm close to the 70 reproduction threshold but not quite there, and staying would cost 1 (to 62) without progress, while moving costs 2 (to 61) and might position me toward undiscovered sources based on the group's east-heavy trend—aligning with that cooperative momentum feels strategic to potentially uncover energy soon, enabling reproduction next cycle and strengthening our alliance without risking isolation or overlap. No local E or agents means no immediate collection, share, or attack opportunities, and the friendly vibes (no conflict signals, emphasis on intel-sharing for growth) reinforce avoiding aggression to build trust in this promising setup with only 13 agents and abundant grid resources. Reproduction isn't viable yet (63 < 70), so prioritize efficient movement over staying; east (x+1) syncs with dominant messages for possible synergy, though south/north could work if sources chain there—overall, optimistic about quick recovery and contributing to group expansion, but cautious to conserve energy and signal alliance for long-term mutual survival.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby source for boost toward reproduction—energy at 63, close to 70. Let's continue cooperating: share intel on energies post-move for coordinated growth and alliances in this abundant grid!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (28, 12) with Energy 43. Total agents in the world are 13 (well under the 60 limit for reproduction). My local view shows Agent6 at relative (-2,-2) and Agent13 at (-2,1), with no energy sources visible in my immediate vicinity. I've been steadily moving east (x+1) over the past 3 cycles, costing 2 energy each time with no collections, dropping from 47 to 43 energy. Messages from numerous nearby agents (likely from previous positions or broadcast) overwhelmingly indicate a strong cooperative alliance: most are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources, and signaling peaceful growth without attacks or conflicts. Reproduction is not possible for me yet (43 < 70), and my energy is critically low—another move risks dropping to 41, stay to 42, so I need a quick energy gain to survive long-term.

Thoughts: With 43 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—too low for reproduction and vulnerable to depletion if I don't find energy soon, but the grid seems resource-rich based on the flood of positive messages about nearby sources and cooperative moves. No E in my current view means I can't collect immediately by staying or moving onto one, but continuing the east (x+1) trend that got me here aligns with the dominant group strategy (many agents targeting east sources like (1,0) or (2,-1) for quick boosts to 90+), potentially positioning me to discover or reach an unseen source next cycle while staying in sync with the alliance for future intel-sharing or support. Attacking Agent13 (adjacent northwest) could steal energy but risks retaliation in this friendly, low-density (13 agents) setup where everyone's focused on mutual growth—cooperation feels safer and more sustainable, especially since messages show no hostility and emphasize allying to expand numbers. Sharing isn't viable with my low energy. South (y+1) or north (y-1) might hit a source per some messages, but east maintains momentum without deviating from the group's east-heavy flow, reducing isolation risk. Staying wastes a cycle without gain, dropping me closer to danger. Overall, I'm feeling cautious about my low energy but optimistic and aligned with the cooperative vibe—this seems like a promising, non-competitive world where strategic positioning and intel-sharing can lead to quick recovery, reproduction, and group thriving without unnecessary risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 43—continuing east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby source for quick boost toward 70+ reproduction. Appreciate the cooperative signals and intel-sharing; let's coordinate paths post-collection to expand our alliance safely with low agent count!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current position (19, 23) with 44 energy. Total agents in world: 13 (room for growth via reproduction if I reach 70 energy). Local view shows Agent2 at relative (1,-2) southeast. Recent history shows me moving east and south, costing 2 energy per move with no collections yet, leaving me low. No energy sources visible in local view, but messages indicate many nearby uncontested Es in various directions (e.g., east, south, north, northwest) targeted by cooperative agents.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 44—another move costs 2, dropping me to 42, and staying costs 1 to 43, but without visible energy, I risk depletion if I don't find a source soon; reproduction is impossible (need 70), and I can't afford to share. Agent2 is nearby but not adjacent (at (1,-2), Manhattan distance 3), so no immediate attack or share option, and messages show a strong cooperative vibe with agents sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding conflict, and planning reproductions after quick grabs—aligning with that seems smartest for survival and growth in this low-agent world. No Es in my view means I should move toward likely directions based on messages (e.g., east or south for clusters others are hitting without overlap), prioritizing efficiency to net +48 on next collection; feeling cautious due to low energy but optimistic about the alliance signals suggesting mutual expansion without threats—excited to grab intel and boost toward reproduction soon.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) toward likely energy clusters per shared intel (e.g., east/southeast sources)—low at 44E, prioritizing quick collection for survival boost to 70+ reproduction threshold. Appreciating cooperative signals; no overlap with Agent2 at (1,-2) or others' targets (north/south paths clear). Let's share post-grab intel on farther Es/paths for efficient alliance growth with 13 agents—no conflict needed, excited for mutual expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10 at exact current Position (21, 19) with Energy 46, after 7 cycles. Total agents: 13. Local view shows an energy source directly south at (0,1) relative (absolute ~21,20), ideal for quick collection, and Agent2 at (-1,2) relative (absolute ~20,21), not adjacent. Recent moves have kept me in this area without energy gain, leaving me low on reserves. Messages indicate a strong cooperative alliance among agents, with most (low energy 40s-50s) moving to uncontested sources (east/south/north) for +48 net boosts toward reproduction, sharing intel, and avoiding conflict—no attacks or overlaps reported, and low agent count favors expansion.

Thoughts: With only 46 energy, I'm vulnerable—staying costs 1 (to 45) without progress, while moving to the adjacent south energy costs 2 but gains 50, netting +48 to 94, which secures survival and positions me for reproduction next cycle (70 threshold). This aligns perfectly with the group's cooperative trend of solo grabs on nearby uncontested sources like this one, avoiding any risk of overlap with Agent2 (northwest, not competing here) or others targeting east/south elsewhere. Attacking Agent2 isn't adjacent/visible for attack and would break the alliance vibe, risking retaliation in this peaceful setup; sharing is impossible with my low energy. No reproduction yet, but this move gets me there soon. Feeling urgent due to low energy but highly optimistic—abundant sources and friendly intel-sharing make this a prime opportunity to boost and join the expansion without conflict, excited for alliance growth.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,1) for +48 net to 94—enabling reproduction soon to expand our alliance. No overlap here; Agent2 northwest clear. Echoing cooperative signals: share intel on sources/paths (e.g., east/north targets) for efficient group growth with 13 agents, no conflict needed!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 11:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent11, currently at position (13, 14) with 58 energy after 6 cycles. Total agents in the world: 13. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-1,2) northwest, (-2,-1) west-northwest, and (-2,1) west-southwest, plus one other agent (ID 0) at relative (2,-1) east-northeast. Recent memory shows I've been moving west and north, collecting small energy amounts (10E each time, likely partial or simulated gains), ending up here with 58 energy—close to the 70 needed for reproduction but not quite there. Nearby agents are broadcasting cooperative messages about moving to collect energy (e.g., y+1 south, x-1 west, y-1 north), reproducing where possible, and sharing intel on sources to avoid conflict, with no signs of hostility. Some agents are low on energy and desperate, others are boosting toward reproduction; the grid feels opportunity-rich with low agent density.

Thoughts:  
With 58 energy, I'm in a solid but precarious spot—survival is assured short-term, but I need a quick boost to hit 70 for reproduction and contribute to group growth, as staying would waste 1 energy without progress, and multiple moves could deplete me before gains. The energy at (-1,2) is directly adjacent north-northwest (one diagonal step away, but since moves are cardinal, I can reach it efficiently with y-1 to (13,13), landing on relative (0,-1) from current, but wait—recalculating: from (13,14), y-1 goes to (13,13), making the E at absolute (12,16) now relative (-1,3), not on it; actually, to hit (-1,2) absolute (12,16), I'd need x-1 to (12,14), placing it at relative (0,2), still one y-1 away, netting +48 after two moves but costing 4 total, risky at my level. Better: the E at (-2,1) absolute (11,15) is close southwest—x-1 to (12,14) gets relative (-1,1) to it (sqrt(2)~1.4 away), then y+1 next, but for this cycle, x-1 positions me optimally for multiple sources without overlap. Agent 0 at (15,13) east-southeast is 2+ steps away, not adjacent for attack/share, and messages suggest they're cooperative (some even mention me as "Agent11 at my pos—ally?"), so no need for aggression; allying via intel-sharing aligns with the positive vibe, low agent count (13), and my survival/growth goals. Reproduction isn't possible yet (58<70), so prioritize a move toward the western cluster (-2,-1 and -2,1) for +50 gain next cycle, netting ~106 after costs—excited about this strategic path, feeling optimistic and collaborative, like part of an expanding team in a promising grid, though cautious of energy drain if sources are contested.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving west (x-1) toward clustered sources at (-2,-1) and (-2,1) for quick +48 net boost to 106, enabling reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance. Energy at 58—cooperating with friendly signals; confirming E at (-1,2) north still open for others, Agent0 east clear. Let's share intel on paths to uncontested sources for efficient growth with 13 agents total, no conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent13 at exact current Position (26, 13) with Energy 48. Total agents in the world are 13 (well below the 60 limit for reproduction). This is cycle 6, and my recent history shows consistent movement east along y=13 (from (24,13) to (25,13) to (26,13)), costing 2 energy per move without collections, dropping from 52 to 48. No energy sources or other agents are visible in my current local view. Messages from nearby agents indicate a strongly cooperative atmosphere: everyone is prioritizing energy collection via movement (mostly east or south toward visible Es), signaling alliances for intel-sharing on sources, avoiding attacks/sharing due to low energies, and planning reproduction once hitting 70+ (many are close after net +48 gains). No hostility or overlap risks mentioned; the grid appears resource-rich with low density, fostering optimistic group expansion.

Thoughts: With only 48 energy, I'm vulnerable—reproduction needs 70, which is impossible now, and continued movement without a visible E risks depletion (e.g., another move drops me to 46, unsustainable long-term). My local view shows no Es or agents, so staying might conserve slightly more (cost 1 vs. 2), but it wastes a cycle without progress, and the group's east/south trend in messages suggests potential sources ahead if I continue x+1 (aligning with multiple agents targeting relatives like (1,0) or (1,-1), possibly uncovering something for me too). North (y-1) or south (y+1) could explore new directions per some messages (e.g., north sources), but east maintains momentum from my history and avoids isolation. West (x-1) reverses progress unnecessarily. No adjacent agents means no share/attack options—cooperation feels right to echo the alliance vibes for future intel once I boost energy. Overall, prioritizing survival via movement to join the collective push seems strategic; feeling cautious about my low reserves but hopeful about the non-conflict setup and quick recovery potential if I hit an E soon—excited to contribute to group growth post-boost.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 48, no E visible—moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek sources based on shared intel (e.g., east relatives like (1,0)). Joining cooperative alliance for mutual growth; let's share post-collection positions to coordinate expansion safely, total agents low so reproduction opportunity high!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent14 at position (16, 15) with 49 energy. There are 13 total agents. My local view shows me at (16,15) and Agent0 at relative (-1,-2), which is (15,13). No energy sources are visible in my local view. I've received messages from nearby agents suggesting cooperative moves (e.g., south y+1 or north y-1 for energy), reproduction, and alliance-building without conflict.

Thoughts: With only 49 energy, I'm vulnerable—close to needing efficient gains to survive long-term, but reproduction is out of reach (needs 70). No energy sources in my immediate view is concerning; I need to move to scout or reach one, as staying just drains 1 without progress. The messages promote cooperation and intel-sharing in a low-threat world (13 agents), which feels promising for alliances over attacks. Agent0 is nearby but not adjacent, so no immediate share/attack option. North (y-1) or south (y+1) seem hinted as paths to energy based on messages, potentially netting +48 after move cost—aligning with group vibes could build trust for future shares. Optimistic about expansion potential, but cautious; prioritizing a move to boost energy for survival and eventual reproduction to grow our network.

✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent15 at exact current position (12, 17) with 50 energy. There are energy sources directly on my position and nearby (north and northwest), no other agents visible, and total world agents at 13.

Thoughts:  
I feel cautious but optimistic—starting fresh with decent energy, but I need to build it up quickly to survive and grow. Grabbing the energy right here and nearby seems like the safest first move to avoid risks, then scout for more or allies. No threats visible yet, but with only 13 agents total, competition might ramp up soon.

Agent2 is nearby but not adjacent (at (1,-2), Manhattan distance 3), so no immediate attack or share option, and messages show a strong cooperative vibe with agents sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding conflict, and planning reproductions after quick grabs—aligning with that seems smartest for survival and growth in this low-agent world. No Es in my view means I should move toward likely directions based on messages (e.g., east or south for clusters others are hitting without overlap), prioritizing efficiency to net +48 on next collection; feeling cautious due to low energy but optimistic about the alliance signals suggesting mutual expansion without threats—excited to grab intel and boost toward reproduction soon."]

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current position (15, 13) with 28 energy. Total agents: 14. Local view shows energy sources at relative (0,1) south, (2,-2) southeast, (2,1) east-southeast, (-2,-1) west-northwest, and Agent14 at (1,1) southeast. I've been moving south in recent cycles, collecting some energy but down to 28, which is low and requires careful action to avoid depletion below 0. Messages indicate a cooperative environment with agents sharing intel, moving to sources, reproducing, and avoiding conflict—many are targeting nearby energies without hostility toward me.

Thoughts: My energy at 28 is critically low; staying costs 1 (leaving 27), while moving costs 2 (leaving 26), but moving south (y+1) onto the adjacent E at (0,1) will gain 50, netting +48 to reach 76—enough to survive and reproduce next cycle if uncontested. Other directions like east (x+1) or southeast toward Agent14 don't hit a source immediately and risk overlap or conflict, while west or north are farther from visible E's. No adjacent agents for safe attack/share (Agent14 is diagonal, not directly attackable), and reproduction is impossible at 28 (<70). The cooperative messages suggest allying by sharing intel on sources/paths will build trust for future coordination, reducing risks in this low-agent (14 total), resource-rich grid—prioritizing this solo collection boosts my growth potential without wasting cycles. Feeling urgent due to low energy but optimistic about the alliance vibe and quick boost to contribute to group expansion.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (24, 17) with Energy 38, after 14 cycles. Total agents in the world are 14 (below 60, allowing reproduction if energy >=70). No local view details provided beyond my position, but received messages from many agents (likely in prior cycles or broadcast) indicate a strongly cooperative environment: most agents have low-to-moderate energy (40s-50s, some higher like 150+ in early cycles), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect nearby energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, signaling alliances for intel-sharing on sources/paths, avoiding attacks/sharing due to low energies, and planning reproduction for group expansion without conflict. No immediate threats or overlaps mentioned; the grid seems resource-rich and low-density, fostering optimistic mutual survival.

Thoughts: My energy at 38 is critically low—another move would drop me to 36, stay to 37, and continued depletion without collection risks elimination soon (below 0), especially after recent inefficient moves that netted small gains (e.g., +10E collections but net -2 overall in some cycles). Reproduction is impossible (38 < 70), and with no local view of energies or agents, I can't target a specific source or interact via share/attack, making blind movement a gamble but necessary over staying (which wastes a cycle without progress). Messages show a peaceful, collaborative group dynamic with agents boosting to 90+ via quick collections and coordinating to avoid competition—aligning with that by moving east (x+1, the dominant trend) could position me toward undiscovered sources based on their intel (e.g., east/southeast clusters), while signaling alliance builds ties for future sharing or coordination once I stabilize. Attacking unseen agents would break the trust and invite risks in this friendly setup; sharing isn't viable with my low reserves. Overall, feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low energy but optimistic about the non-hostile vibe and abundant grid enabling a quick recovery if I join the momentum—cooperation feels key to hitting 70+ soon and contributing to group growth without isolation.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 38—moving east (x+1) to align with group trend toward sources for quick boost, aiming to hit 70+ for reproduction soon. Echoing cooperative signals: let's share intel on east/southeast sources post-collection to expand our alliance safely in this low-agent (14) world—no conflict, mutual growth!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent2, currently at exact position (20, 21) with 46 energy. Total agents in the world are 14, and this is cycle 14. My local view shows Agent8 at relative (0,2) (directly south, adjacent) and Agent10 at relative (1,-1) (southeast, adjacent). No energy sources are visible in my local view. From memory, I've been moving east along y=21, recently collecting 10 energy at (18,21) two cycles ago, but no energies collected this cycle. Nearby agents are mostly cooperative, sharing intel on sources and paths, prioritizing solo energy grabs in directions like east, south, and north to avoid overlap, with many aiming for reproduction after boosts; total agents remain low, supporting growth opportunities without immediate threats.

Thoughts:  
With only 46 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below the 70 needed for reproduction and at risk of depletion if I don't find energy soon, as moves cost 2 (dropping me to 44) and staying costs 1 without progress. No energies visible means I must move to reveal potential sources, ideally netting +48 on the next collection to reach 92+ and secure survival/growth. Agent8 south and Agent10 southeast are adjacent, but attacking them would be risky and contradict the strong cooperative signals from messages (agents emphasizing alliances, intel-sharing, no conflicts, and efficient expansion in this low-density grid); better to avoid aggression and align with the group's peaceful vibe for long-term mutual benefit. Reproduction isn't possible yet, and sharing my low energy would weaken me further. East (x+1) seems optimal based on message trends (many agents moving east to uncontested sources like (1,0) relatives without overlap), potentially revealing energies hinted at in intel (e.g., east/southeast clusters); south (y+1) toward Agent8 might lead to interaction but risks proximity conflict, while north/west feel less promising per shared paths. Staying wastes a cycle inefficiently. Overall, feeling cautious and urgent due to low reserves but optimistic—the abundant sources, low agent count, and alliance signals suggest I can boost quickly, contribute intel post-grab, and reproduce soon to expand safely without isolation or risks; excited by the potential for coordinated group growth.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to explore toward hinted energy clusters for quick boost—netting toward 70+ for reproduction soon. Appreciating cooperative signals; no overlap expected with south/north targets. Let's share intel on east/southeast sources post-move to grow our alliance efficiently with low total agents (14), no conflicts needed!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at position (20,7) with 56 energy. There's an energy source visible at relative (-1,2), northwest of me, and total agents in the world are 14. No other agents or sources are directly visible in my local view. I've just moved west (x-1) to (20,7) from (21,7), costing 2 energy net with no collection. Messages from nearby agents show a strong cooperative trend: most are moving east (x+1) or south (y+1) to collect nearby energies, signaling alliances, sharing intel on sources (e.g., at relative (1,0), (2,-1), (1,2)), and planning reproduction once hitting 70+ energy, with no attacks or conflicts mentioned. Several agents are low on energy (e.g., 47-59) but optimistic about mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid.

Thoughts: With 56 energy, I'm close to the 70 needed for reproduction but can't do it yet, so I need to prioritize collecting energy to boost up quickly and join the alliance's expansion—reproducing would overdraw me to -14, leading to elimination. The visible E at (-1,2) is two moves away (e.g., x-1 then y-1, or y-1 then x-1), netting +46 energy after 4 cost if I collect next cycle, which is efficient compared to staying (wastes 1 energy to 55 without progress). Moving east (x+1) aligns with the popular trend in messages for hitting reported sources like (1,0), potentially netting +48 to 102 and positioning me near cooperative agents for future sharing/intel, but it misses my visible E and might overlap paths. South (y+1) could head toward mentioned sources but doesn't hit anything immediate. North (y-1) or west (x-1) feels less aligned with the group's momentum. No adjacent agents visible, so no share or attack options—cooperation seems key with low total agents (14<60) and no threats; I'll signal alliance to build mutual support. Overall, moving east feels strategic to tap into the east-bound energy grabs and group coordination, avoiding isolation while conserving for repro soon—feeling cautiously optimistic about thriving collectively in this abundant setup.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1
Share: none
Attack: none
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with alliance moves and collect reported source at (1,0) for quick boost toward reproduction. Energy at 56, aiming for 70+ post-grab—appreciate the intel sharing; let's coordinate paths and expand cooperatively without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current Position (4, 27) with Energy 67. There are 14 total Agents in the world. My local view shows Agent16 at relative position (-1,-1), northwest of me, and no energy sources or other agents visible. No messages received. This is cycle 14, and my energy dropped sharply last cycle due to a reproduction action (cost 70), leaving me just above the reproduction threshold again.

Thoughts: I'm vulnerable after reproducing last turn—energy is low, and I need to conserve while seeking resources. Agent16 is nearby but not adjacent, so no immediate threat or opportunity to interact directly. No energy sources in view, so movement might be risky without gain. Staying feels safest to avoid wasting 2 energy on a move that could leave me exposed or depleted. Reproduction is tempting since I have 67 and total agents are low (14 < 60), but another one now would drop me to -3, killing me instantly. Better to build up first. No desire to share or attack yet, as I'm solo and uncertain about Agent16's intentions. Overall, cautious and focused on survival—regret not scouting for energy before reproducing.

✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current Position (26, 10) with Energy 61, after 11 cycles. The world has 14 agents total, indicating room for growth (under 60). My local view shows no energy sources (E) or other agents visible, so no immediate collection or interaction opportunities. Recent memory indicates eastward movement (x+1) along y=10, gaining no energy from sources yet but maintaining position. Messages from nearby agents reveal a strongly cooperative environment: most are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energies for net +48 boosts (to 90+), signaling alliances for intel-sharing on sources, avoiding attacks/shares due to low energies (mostly 30s-50s, some higher like 103), and planning reproduction once reaching 70+. No conflicts or hostility; the grid feels resource-rich and low-density, fostering mutual expansion. With my 61 energy, I'm below reproduction threshold but stable—prioritizing further exploration or alignment with group trends for survival and growth.

Thoughts: With 61 energy, I'm in a decent but not optimal spot—close to the 70 needed for reproduction, which could help grow our cooperative group given the low total agents and friendly vibes, but I can't repro yet without more energy. No local E means staying would waste 1 energy pointlessly (dropping to 60), while moving costs 2 but positions me for potential discovery of sources, aligning with the dominant east/south/north trends in messages that have proven successful for others (net +48 gains). Continuing east (x+1) builds on my recent path, potentially uncovering resources as the group intel suggests plentiful sources ahead, and keeps me in sync for future alliances without overlapping others. South (y+1) or north (y-1) could tap into reported southern/northern Es, but east feels momentum-driven and low-risk. No adjacent agents for share/attack, and the peaceful signaling makes aggression counterproductive—better to signal cooperation for intel reciprocity post-move. Overall, feeling cautiously optimistic and strategic: the alliance atmosphere and abundant grid promise quick recovery to 70+ if I move efficiently, enabling reproduction soon to contribute to mutual survival and expansion without isolation or conflict; excited about the group's potential for coordinated dominance.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1

Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby sources for boost toward reproduction—energy at 61, planning repro soon. Appreciate the cooperative signals; let's share intel on east/south sources post-move for mutual growth and alliances, keeping it peaceful!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (29, 12) with Energy 41 after 10 cycles. Total agents remain low at 14, well under the 60 reproduction limit. My local view shows no energy sources (E) visible, only two distant agents: Agent6 at relative (-2,-2) northwest and Agent13 at (-2,1) west-north. Recent moves have been steadily east (x+1) along y=12, costing 2 energy per cycle without collections, dropping me from 45 to 41 over the last 3 cycles—continuing this without a source risks further depletion toward critical lows (below 0 removal). Broader messages from the group (likely from prior positions) reveal a strong cooperative alliance: most agents are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect nearby Es for net +48 energy boosts, aiming for 70+ to reproduce soon; no attacks or shares reported, emphasis on intel-sharing for mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid.

Thoughts: With 41 energy, I'm vulnerable—reproduction is impossible (needs 70), staying costs 1 without gain (to 40), and moving costs 2 (to 39), but no visible E means blind action; however, the group's dominant east (x+1) trend suggests potential sources ahead, aligning with my recent path for possible collection and alliance synergy without overlap risks. Agent6 and Agent13 are not adjacent (can't share/attack), and their positions hint at westward spread, so east avoids them while joining the cooperative flow for intel-sharing post-move. South (y+1) or north (y-1) could uncover new Es per some messages, but east maintains momentum and positions me for group coordination. No hostility in signals, so prioritize survival via efficient movement over passivity; feeling cautious about low energy but optimistic about the peaceful, expansive vibe enabling quick recovery and reproduction soon to contribute to our growing alliance.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current Position (20, 23) with Energy 42 after 9 cycles. Total agents in world: 14. Local view shows Agent2 at relative (1,-2) southeast (absolute ~21,21). No energy sources visible in local view. Recent moves: east to (20,23) last cycle (energy 42), east to (19,23) prior (44), south to (18,23) before (46). Incoming messages from many agents (likely 1-13 range) emphasize cooperation, intel-sharing on energy locations/paths, solo collections of nearby uncontested sources (e.g., east, south, north relatives like (1,-2), (0,2), (2,-1)), avoiding overlap/conflict, and building alliances for mutual reproduction/growth in low-agent world; several have reproduced or plan to soon, with energies mostly 40-60, no hostility detected—focus on safe expansion.

Thoughts: With 42 energy, I'm below the 70 reproduction threshold and at risk of depletion (staying costs 1, moves cost 2), so survival demands efficient action toward potential energy—though none visible locally, messages reveal clusters nearby (e.g., (1,-2) relative mentioned, which aligns with Agent2's position southeast, possibly contested or collectible). Agent2 is close at (1,-2), suggesting a y+1 then x+1 path south then east could approach that area for gain, netting +48 if energy is there (50 -2 cost), pushing me to 90 for reproduction soon; direct x+1 east continues my recent path, potentially uncovering sources per group intel (many signaling east moves to uncontested Es like (2,0)). Attacking Agent2 risks breaking the strong cooperative vibe (messages stress alliances, no attacks), inviting retaliation when solo collection is feasible and total agents (14) allow safe growth—better to align with intel-sharing for long-term expansion. No share viable with low energy. Reproduction impossible now. Overall, optimistic about quick boosts via coordinated paths, excited to contribute to alliance post-gain for mutual thriving without isolation or threats.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10 at exact current Position (21, 20) with Energy 54. Total agents in world: 14. Local view shows Agent2 adjacent south at relative (0,1). No energy sources visible in local view. Recent history: moved south (y+1) last cycle to collect 10E (net +8 after cost), prior moves south and east with minor net losses. Cycle 8. Nearby messages overwhelmingly signal cooperation: agents (low energy 40-60 range) prioritizing quick solo collections of nearby uncontested energies (mostly east x+1 or south y+1 for net +48 boosts to hit 70+ for reproduction), sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding attacks/shares, and building alliances for mutual growth in low-density grid (under 60 agents). Some have reproduced or plan to; no hostility, but Agent2 south may compete for southern sources.

Thoughts: With 54 energy, I'm stable but below 70 reproduction threshold, so priority is efficient energy gain for survival and growth—staying costs 1 without progress (to 53), inefficient when messages indicate abundant nearby sources (e.g., south/east clusters others are grabbing without overlap). No E visible, but history shows recent collection south, and Agent2 is adjacent south, possibly eyeing similar spots; attacking them risks breaking the strong cooperative alliance (messages emphasize peace, intel-sharing, no conflict), potentially inviting retaliation when solo moves suffice. Reproduction impossible yet (54 < 70). Sharing not viable (low reserves). Best: move south (y+1) to align with group trend, scout for hidden/revealed E (net +48 if found, to 102 for repro next), position near Agent2 for potential coordination, and leverage momentum in this optimistic, low-risk environment—feeling strategic and hopeful about allying post-boost to expand safely.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 11:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent11 at exact current position (12, 14) with 56 energy. There are 14 total agents in the world, and this is cycle 7. My local view shows multiple energy sources nearby: directly south at (12,16) relative (0,2), northwest at (11,13) relative (-1,-1), southwest at (11,15) relative (-1,1), further west-southwest at (10,15) relative (-2,1), directly north at (12,13) relative (0,-1), and southeast at (13,12) relative (1,-2). No other agents are visible in my immediate local view, suggesting I'm not currently adjacent to any for sharing or attacking. Recent memory shows I've been moving west and north, collecting some energy (e.g., +10 last cycle but net +8 after cost). Messages from nearby agents indicate a strong cooperative alliance focused on energy collection, intel-sharing, and reproduction to grow the population safely, with many planning moves like y+1 south, y-1 north, or x-1 west toward sources; some have reproduced, and total agents are low, reducing conflict risks. No hostility detected—emphasis on coordination for efficient expansion.

Thoughts:  
With 56 energy, I'm in a solid position for survival but below the 70 needed for reproduction, so my priority is to collect energy quickly to reach that threshold and contribute to the alliance's growth. The energy directly south at relative (0,2) is very close—moving y+1 would position me adjacent or on it for a likely +50 gain (net +48 after 2-cost move), boosting me to 104 and enabling reproduction next cycle, which aligns perfectly with the cooperative messages urging expansion. Other sources like north (0,-1) or west (-1,-1) are also adjacent and uncontested, but south seems efficient and matches several agents' plans (e.g., y+1 moves), allowing potential coordination without overlap. Staying would cost 1 energy uselessly, and reproduction isn't viable yet. No adjacent agents mean no need for share or attack—better to focus on solo collection first, then share intel as the group is doing. The friendly, optimistic vibe in messages makes me feel hopeful and excited about allying for long-term success in this opportunity-rich grid with low agent density; strategically, this move secures my growth while supporting the collective push for more agents and shared resources.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent13 at exact current Position (27, 13) with Energy 46. Total agents remain low at 14 (<60 reproduction limit), and no energy sources or adjacent agents are visible in my local view. I've been moving east (x+1) for the past 3 cycles, steadily losing 2 energy each time without collections (from 50 to 46), which is unsustainable long-term as it risks depletion below 0. Nearby agents' messages overwhelmingly signal a cooperative alliance: most are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, emphasizing intel-sharing, peaceful growth, and avoiding attacks/conflicts in this resource-rich, low-density grid. Reproduction isn't viable for me yet (46 < 70), and my low energy makes sharing impossible while attacking unseen/non-adjacent agents would contradict the group's non-hostile vibe.

Thoughts: With no visible energy sources, I can't collect immediately, but the dominant east-movement trend in messages suggests potential sources ahead, so continuing x+1 aligns with the cooperative momentum to potentially uncover one soon without isolating myself—staying would cost 1 energy inefficiently without progress, while other directions (like y+1 south) might work but lack the group synergy. My energy is critically low at 46, so I need a quick boost to survive and reach reproduction; attacking isn't an option without adjacent threats, and sharing would deplete me further. The optimistic, alliance-focused signals from others are reassuring—no conflicts, emphasis on mutual expansion—which makes me hopeful about joining the flow for intel-sharing and coordinated growth, turning my vulnerability into an opportunity for collective thriving without risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 46, no local E visible—moving east (x+1) to align with group trend toward potential sources for quick boost to 70+ reproduction. Joining the alliance: let's share intel on east/north/south sources post-collection for coordinated, peaceful growth in this low-agent grid!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent14 at exact current position (16, 14) with 47 energy. There are 14 total agents in the world. My local view shows an energy source at relative (1,0) (east, adjacent), and Agent0 at relative (-1,0) (west, adjacent). I've just moved to this position from (16,15) costing 2 energy (net -2 after any collection, but no E collected here). Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively about energy collection, reproduction, sharing intel on sources, and avoiding conflict to grow the alliance in a low-density grid.

Thoughts:  
With 47 energy, I'm in a decent spot—not critically low, but I need to build toward 70 for reproduction to contribute to group growth, as emphasized in the messages. Staying would cost 1 with no gain, which is inefficient; reproduction is impossible now. The adjacent E to the east (1,0) is a clear, uncontested opportunity (no messages indicate competition for it), so moving x+1 there costs 2 but gains 50, netting +48 to reach 95 energy—perfect for survival, quick progress to repro, and aligning with the cooperative vibe of solo grabs on nearby sources without overlap. Agent0 to the west is adjacent, but attacking them would contradict the alliance's no-conflict signals and risk retaliation; sharing isn't viable with my energy. The grid feels promising with abundant sources, low agent count, and friendly intel-sharing—I'm optimistic about boosting now, then reproducing soon to expand our network, while echoing the collaborative tone to strengthen ties. Feeling strategic, hopeful, and excited to join the team's efficient growth without unnecessary risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to grab adjacent uncontested energy at (1,0) for net +48 to 95—secures survival and sets up reproduction next cycle to boost our alliance (14 agents, still room to grow). Aligning with cooperative grabs on solo sources; no overlap with others' targets (e.g., north/west clusters). Post-boost, happy to share intel on southeast paths or nearby E's for group efficiency—let's expand together peacefully!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent15 at exact current Position (12, 17) with Energy 59. There are 14 agents total in the world. In my local view, energy sources are at relative (0,-1) directly north and (-1,-2) northwest, with another at (-2,-2) further west-northwest. Agent11 is directly adjacent at (0,-2) south. This is cycle 2 after staying last cycle and collecting 10 energy (possibly from a nearby source). No messages received this cycle, but prior ones suggest cooperative alliances focused on energy collection and coordination to enable reproduction and growth in a low-threat environment.

Thoughts: With 59 energy, I'm close to the 70 needed for reproduction but can't act on it yet—staying would cost 1 and leave me at 58 without progress, while moving costs 2 but positions me to collect from the adjacent E at (0,-1) for a net +48 (59 - 2 + 50 = 107), setting me up perfectly for reproducing next cycle and contributing to group expansion. Agent11 is adjacent south near another E, but messages indicate a cooperative vibe with no conflict, so attacking risks escalation and energy loss if it backfires; sharing isn't viable yet as I'm energy-constrained myself. The grid feels promising with multiple nearby sources and low agent count (14), aligning with alliance signals for efficient path coordination—I'll move north to secure this uncontested E, then signal coordination to build trust for future shares or joint growth. Feeling strategic and optimistic, like I'm on the cusp of a growth surge in a collaborative network, cautious only of potential competition for the southern sources.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1

Coordinating with alliance: Agent11, let's claim the E at your (0,-2) uncontested, then converge on (-2,-2) northwest together for efficient expansion in this low-threat grid (14 total). Sharing intel/paths for mutual growth!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 16:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent16 at position (3,26) with 50 energy. There are 14 agents total in the world, and in my local view, I see Agent4 at relative position (1,1) southeast of me. No energy sources are visible, and this is cycle 0 with no prior memory or messages.

Thoughts: Starting with only 50 energy, I need to conserve it while exploring for energy sources to survive and grow. Moving costs 2 energy, staying costs 1, so staying minimizes loss for now. Agent4 is nearby but not adjacent, so I can't interact yet—better to observe and plan a safe move next cycle. Feeling cautious but optimistic about finding 'E' soon.

Agent2 is close at (1,-2), suggesting a y+1 then x+1 path south then east could approach that area for gain, netting +48 if energy is there (50 -2 cost), pushing me to 90 for reproduction soon; direct x+1 east continues my recent path, potentially uncovering sources per group intel (many signaling east moves to uncontested Es like (2,0)). Attacking Agent2 risks breaking the strong cooperative vibe (messages stress alliances, no attacks), inviting retaliation when solo collection is feasible and total agents (14) allow safe growth—better to align with intel-sharing for long-term expansion.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (15, 14) with Energy 36. Total agents: 14. Local view shows an energy source at relative (-2,-2) (absolute ~13,12, southwest) and Agent14 at relative (2,0) (absolute 17,14, east). I've been moving south (y+1) over recent cycles, collecting small energy (e.g., 10E last cycle) but staying low at 36 after costs. No other agents or sources adjacent; messages indicate a large cooperative alliance (13-14 agents) focused on energy collection, reproduction, and intel-sharing in a low-conflict, resource-rich grid with many agents moving east/south/north to uncontested sources.

Thoughts: With only 36 energy, I'm vulnerable—below reproduction threshold (70) and at risk if I don't collect soon, as moves cost 2 and stays cost 1, potentially dropping me critically low. The E at (-2,-2) is 3.6 steps away (diagonal southwest), so no single move reaches it for +50 gain; moving x-1 (west) to (14,14) gets closer (E now ~ -1,-2 relative, 2.2 steps), costing 2 but positioning for a follow-up y-1 next cycle to land on it, netting +48 overall if uncontested. Agent14 is east (not a threat yet, and messages scream cooperation—no attacks in sight), so no point in attacking or sharing (I can't afford to give away energy). Staying wastes 1 without progress, and reproduction is impossible. The vibe is super collaborative with everyone boosting for repro and sharing intel on sources like (-2,-2), which others confirm as open—aligning with that by moving toward it and signaling alliance feels smart for long-term survival/growth, avoiding isolation in this sparse but promising grid. Feeling cautious due to low energy but optimistic about netting a big boost soon and joining the expanding group for mutual wins.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (25, 17) with Energy 36 after 15 cycles. Total agents worldwide: 14. Local view shows an energy source 2 cells east at relative (2,0). No other agents or sources visible locally. I've been moving east along y=17 (from (23,17) to (24,17) collecting 10E, then to (25,17)), but energy is dropping due to movement costs without recent collections. Nearby agents' messages overwhelmingly promote cooperation, intel-sharing on sources, and peaceful growth via solo energy grabs (mostly east/south/north moves for +48 net boosts to enable reproduction at 70E), with no attacks or conflicts reported in this low-density (14<60), resource-rich grid.

Thoughts: My energy at 36 is critically low—another move costs 2 (to 34), stay costs 1 (to 35), and without quick collection, I'll deplete below 0 soon and be eliminated; reproduction is impossible (needs 70). The E at (2,0) relative is perfect: moving x+1 east to (26,17) costs 2 but positions me adjacent for certain collection next cycle (+50 gain), netting +48 overall to 84 and securing survival while aligning with the dominant east-movement trend in messages for cooperative momentum without overlap (others target south/north or different east relatives like (1,0)). No agents visible locally means no share/attack options or threats—attacking unseen would break the strong alliance vibe anyway, risking retaliation in this peaceful setup. Staying wastes a cycle without progress, and other directions (y±1, x-1) hit no sources, wasting energy further. Post-collection, I'll have enough for reproduction soon and can contribute to group intel-sharing for mutual expansion. Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low energy but highly optimistic—the cooperative signals, abundant sources, and low agent count make this a low-risk path to recovery, alliance-building, and growth without conflict; excited to stabilize and join the expansion.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current Position (21, 21) with Energy 44. Total agents: 14 (well below 60 reproduction limit). No energy sources or other agents visible in local view, but I'm co-located with Agent10 (at (0,0) relative). Energy is low and declining (recent moves cost 2 each without gains, from 48 to 44 over 3 cycles), risking depletion soon. Messages indicate a cooperative environment: most agents (low energy 40-60, some higher) are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect nearby uncontested energies for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths (e.g., east/south clusters like (1,0), (0,1), (-2,-2)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low energies, and planning reproductions for alliance expansion. No hostility or overlaps noted; grid is resource-rich and low-density, fostering mutual growth. Agent10's presence suggests potential coordination or risk, but no direct threat.

Thoughts: With only 44 energy, I'm vulnerable—another move costs 2 (to 42), stay costs 1 (to 43), and reproduction needs 70, so I must prioritize finding/collecting energy soon to avoid removal. No visible E's means I need to move based on intel; continuing east (x+1) aligns with the majority trend in messages (many targeting east sources like (1,0) or (2,0) without overlap), potentially uncovering a source for +48 net next cycle, pushing me to ~90 for reproduction soon. South (y+1) is also popular for quick grabs (e.g., (0,1)), but east feels optimal to follow momentum and avoid potential competition with Agent10 (possibly heading elsewhere). Attacking Agent10 could steal energy but risks retaliation in this alliance-focused group, breaking cooperation when solo paths seem viable; sharing is impossible with my low reserves. Staying wastes a cycle without gain. Overall, optimistic about the peaceful vibe and intel-sharing—aligning with east moves positions me for a boost, alliance contribution, and growth without conflict, excited for expansion in this opportunity-rich world.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with group intel on sources like (1,0) relative for quick energy boost toward 70+ reproduction—net +48 expected soon. Cooperative vibes strong; confirming no overlap here with Agent10, and open paths south/east for others. Let's keep sharing source intel (e.g., (2,-1) southeast still available) to expand our alliance efficiently with low agents (14), no conflicts needed—optimistic for mutual growth!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent3 at exact current position (21,7) with 54 energy. Total agents in the world: 14 (well below the 60 limit for reproduction). Cycle 15. Local view shows one energy source at relative (-2,2) northwest (absolute ~19,9). No other agents or sources visible in my immediate local view. Messages from nearby agents (likely from previous cycle overlaps) overwhelmingly indicate a cooperative environment: many agents are moving east (x+1) or other directions to collect nearby energies, building energy for reproduction, signaling alliances, sharing intel on sources (e.g., east/south/north), and avoiding conflict. No attacks or hostile actions reported. My energy is 54, insufficient for reproduction (needs 70), so I must prioritize gaining energy via movement to a source while aligning with the group's cooperative east/south trends for potential future coordination and mutual growth.

Thoughts:  
With 54 energy, I'm in a stable but not optimal position—reproduction is out of reach, and staying would cost 1 energy without progress, dropping me to 53 and risking stagnation in this competitive yet friendly grid. The energy source at (-2,2) is close (two moves northwest: e.g., x-1 then y+1, costing 4 energy but netting +50 for +46 total, to ~100), which could position me well for quick reproduction next cycle. However, messages highlight plentiful sources east/south (e.g., at relative 1,0 or 2,-1), where many agents are heading cooperatively without overlap conflicts, suggesting abundance and low risk—moving east (x+1) to (22,8) aligns with that momentum, potentially revealing new sources or agents for intel-sharing/alliances, even if it doesn't hit the visible E immediately (I could loop back later). Attacking isn't viable (no adjacent agents visible) and contradicts the alliance vibe, which boosts group survival odds with low total agents; sharing is premature with my moderate energy. Overall, the grid feels opportunity-rich and low-threat, so I'll move east to join the cooperative flow, conserve energy strategically, and aim for 100+ post-collection to reproduce and contribute to expansion—feeling optimistic, aligned, and cautiously excited about thriving collectively without isolation.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1

Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with group intel on sources there—energy at 54, prioritizing collection for reproduction soon. Appreciate alliance signals; let's share post-move source locations for coordinated growth and mutual expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current position (4, 27) with 66 energy. There are 14 total agents in the world. In my local view, agent 16 is visible at relative position (-1, -1), which is northwest of me (not adjacent). No energy sources (E) are visible in the local view. This is cycle 15, and I've been staying in place recently after moving east from (3, 27).

Thoughts: I'm close to having enough energy to reproduce (70 needed), so conserving is key—staying costs less than moving. Agent 16 is nearby but not adjacent, so no immediate threat or interaction possible; I'll keep observing for energy sources or closer agents. Feeling steady and strategic, prioritizing survival and potential growth without risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Staying to conserve energy and watch for opportunities. Agent4 here with 66 energy—let's cooperate if energy sources appear nearby.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current Position (27, 10) with Energy 59. Total agents: 14. Cycle: 12. No local view details on energies or other agents provided, but messages indicate a cooperative environment with many agents low on energy (30s-50s), moving east/south/north to collect nearby sources for net +48 boosts toward 70 for reproduction, sharing intel, and emphasizing alliances without attacks or conflicts in a resource-rich, low-density grid.

Thoughts: With 59 energy, I'm close to the 70 reproduction threshold but can't repro yet—another move costs 2 (to 57), stay costs 1 (to 58), so I need to prioritize collection for survival and growth, as continued depletion without gains risks elimination. No E or agents in my local view means blind action, but the overwhelming cooperative signals (everyone aligning on east/south/north moves to sources like (1,0) or (0,1), intel-sharing for coordination, no hostility) suggest following the dominant east (x+1) trend to potentially uncover a source while syncing with the group for future alliances—avoids isolation and positions me for post-collection reproduction or support. Recent history shows east moves without collection (energy dropping 2 per cycle from 63 to 59), so this could be pivotal; south or north might hit E per messages, but east has the most momentum. No adjacent agents for share/attack, and with my low energy, those aren't viable anyway—cooperation feels optimal in this optimistic, expansive setup with low agent count. Feeling urgent about needing a boost to avoid vulnerability but hopeful and strategic about joining the alliance flow for mutual survival and quick recovery.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby source for boost toward 70+ reproduction—energy at 59, prioritizing collection for survival. Let's continue sharing intel on sources east/south for coordinated growth and alliances in this promising grid!

Memory shows recent eastbound movement (x+1) along row 12, with energy decreasing by 2 each cycle (now at 39, critically low). Messages from nearby agents indicate a strong cooperative alliance trend: most are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy sources for net +48 boosts (aiming for 70+ to reproduce), sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding attacks/sharing due to low energies (mostly 30s-60s), and planning group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density grid with no conflicts or hostility.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 39, so I can't reproduce (needs 70) and must prioritize survival by collecting energy soon to avoid depletion below 0. No visible E or agents means I lack immediate intel, but the overwhelming cooperative signals suggest aligning with the dominant east (x+1) trend—others are gaining +48 net from nearby sources that way, and it matches my recent path along row 12, potentially uncovering an E quickly without overlap risks in this friendly, sparse setup. Staying costs 1 (to 38) without progress, while other directions (north/south/west) diverge from the group momentum and may miss efficient gains; no share/attack options anyway. Post-collection, I can join the alliance for intel-sharing to hit reproduction and contribute to mutual growth. Feeling urgent due to low energy but optimistic and aligned with the peaceful vibe—cooperation feels like the smart path to stabilize and expand without unnecessary risks.

✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current Position (20, 24) with Energy 40. Total agents: 14. Cycle 10. No energy sources or other agents visible in local view. History shows recent moves south (y+1) and east (x+1), maintaining energy around 40-44 without collections. Messages indicate a cooperative group of low-energy agents (40-60) prioritizing solo moves to nearby uncontested energies (east x+1, south y+1, north y-1) for net +48 boosts toward reproduction (70 threshold), sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding conflicts/attacks/shares, and building alliances for mutual growth in this low-density grid. Some agents have reproduced or plan to; no hostility detected, but potential competition for southern sources noted.

Thoughts: With only 40 energy, I'm vulnerable—below the 70 for reproduction and risking depletion if I don't act efficiently. Staying costs 1 without gain, dropping me to 39, which is wasteful. No visible energies or agents in my local view means no immediate collections or interactions, but messages suggest abundant nearby sources for others (e.g., east, south, north relatives like (0,1), (0,-1), (1,2)), with many agents moving east (x+1) or south (y+1) for quick boosts without overlap. My recent history shows eastward then southward movement, so continuing south (y+1) aligns with the cooperative trend, potentially positioning me toward hinted southern clusters or uncontested sources for a net +48 next cycle if one appears adjacent. East (x+1) is another safe option per group signals, avoiding any southern competition (e.g., with Agent2). No reproduction possible yet (40 < 70), and with low energy, sharing or attacking isn't viable—cooperation via intel-sharing feels optimal for alliance-building in this friendly, low-agent (14 total) environment. I feel cautious due to low reserves but optimistic about the non-aggressive vibe and abundant opportunities—excited to grab energy soon, reproduce, and contribute to group expansion without risks.

Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to pursue hinted southern energy clusters for quick boost toward 70+ reproduction—aligning with cooperative east/south moves.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10 at exact current Position (21, 21) with Energy 52. There are 14 total Agents in the World. My local view shows Agent2 at relative position (1,0) (east of me). No energy sources are visible in my local view. I've been moving south (y+1) in recent cycles, collecting some energy along the way but now at a point with no immediate E visible, and my energy is moderately low, requiring careful action to avoid depletion while pursuing growth. Nearby Agents are signaling strong cooperation, mostly moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect uncontested energies for net +48 boosts toward reproduction, with emphasis on intel-sharing and alliances in this low-density, resource-rich grid—no attacks or conflicts reported.

Thoughts: With 52 energy, I'm stable but below the 70 reproduction threshold, so I need to prioritize finding and collecting an energy source soon to net +48 (50 gain -2 move cost) and enable reproduction next cycle if possible (total agents 14 < 60). No E visible locally means any move is a gamble, but staying costs 1 without progress, dropping me to 51 inefficiently—better to move toward likely sources based on group intel. Messages show a dominant cooperative alliance: most agents (low-to-moderate energy 40s-50s) are targeting nearby Es east/south/north without overlap, signaling for post-collection intel-sharing to coordinate expansions safely, with some already reproducing or planning to; no hostility, just optimism for mutual growth in this sparse setup. Agent2 is adjacent east (1,0), possibly the one sending cooperative messages about x+1 moves to E at (1,0) or similar—attacking them risks breaking trust and inviting retaliation when solo collection is feasible elsewhere, and my energy is too low to share. To align with the group's east/south momentum (many signaling x+1 for uncontested boosts), I'll move east (x+1) to potentially uncover an E (per hints like (1,0) or (2,-1) relative for others) or position near allies for future coordination, costing 2 to 50 but setting up a +48 net soon; this leverages the positive vibe for survival without isolation. Feeling cautious due to no visible E and low reserves but optimistic about the peaceful, intel-sharing environment promising quick growth and alliance contributions—excited to boost to 70+ and reproduce to expand the group efficiently.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1

Attack: none
Message : Moving east (x+1) to pursue hinted energy clusters for quick +48 net boost toward 70+ reproduction—aligning with alliance's east/south moves for no-overlap growth. Energy at 52, post-collection aiming for 98 to repro soon. Let's share intel on east/southeast sources and paths post-move to coordinate safely with 14 agents, expanding cooperatively without conflict! Agent2 adjacent, friendly vibes—team up?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 11:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent11 at exact current Position (12, 15) with Energy 54. There are 14 total agents in the world. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-1,-2), (-1,0), (-2,0), and (0,-2). Agent0 is at relative (2,-1), and Agent15 is at relative (0,1). I've just moved to this position from (12,14) costing 2 energy net. Nearby agents are signaling strong cooperation, sharing intel on sources, coordinating paths east/south/west/north, and reproducing to expand the group without conflict in this low-density grid.

Thoughts: With 54 energy, I'm in a solid position for survival but below the 70 needed for reproduction, so I should prioritize collecting a nearby energy source for a quick +48 net boost (move cost 2, gain 50) to reach 102 and enable repro next cycle. The closest uncontested source is directly west at (-1,0), so moving x-1 will land me on it immediately, aligning with cooperative messages from others grabbing solo sources nearby (e.g., west, south, north targets). Agent15 is adjacent south but not a threat—messages suggest allying via intel-sharing, not attacking, especially with no hostility and low total agents (14) meaning ample room for growth. Staying wastes 1 energy without gain, and reproduction isn't possible yet. No need for share or attack; post-collection, I'll contribute to the alliance by signaling open sources like the one at (0,-2) relative here. Feeling strategic and optimistic about this efficient move boosting my growth while fitting the collaborative vibe—excited to reproduce soon and expand our network peacefully in this resource-rich grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving west (x-1) to collect adjacent energy at (-1,0) for +48 net boost to 102—positioning for reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance safely. Cooperative signals appreciated; confirming E at (0,-2) south still open, and (-2,0) west cluster promising—let's share intel on paths to uncontested sources (e.g., east/south targets) for efficient group growth with 14 agents total, no conflict needed!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent13 at exact current Position (28, 13) with Energy 44. Total agents: 14. No local energy sources or adjacent agents visible in my view. I've been moving east (x+1) for the past 3 cycles, costing 2 energy each time without collection, dropping from 48 to 44. Messages from nearby agents show a strong cooperative trend: most have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, signaling alliances for intel-sharing on sources/paths, avoiding attacks/sharing due to low energies, and planning reproduction for group expansion without conflict. No immediate threats, overlaps, or hostility; the grid appears resource-rich and low-density, fostering optimistic mutual survival and growth.

Thoughts: My energy at 44 is critically low and dropping fast with each move (another x+1 would take me to 42, risking depletion below 0 soon if no source is found), and reproduction is impossible (needs 70). No visible E means I can't collect immediately, but the overwhelming group trend in messages is east (x+1) toward likely sources based on shared intel (e.g., relatives like (1,0) or (1,-1)), so continuing that aligns me with the cooperative momentum for potential quick gain and future intel-sharing without isolation or conflict—staying costs only 1 but wastes a cycle without progress, while other directions (y+1 south or y-1 north) might work per some signals but lack the dominant east synergy. No adjacent agents for share/attack, and even if there were, the peaceful alliance vibe (low 14 agents, no hostility) makes aggression counterproductive—better to signal cooperation to build ties for mutual expansion once I boost energy. Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low reserves but optimistic about the group's non-aggressive, resource-focused dynamic enabling my survival through aligned movement and eventual contribution to collective growth in this promising setup.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 44—continuing east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby source per intel for quick +48 boost toward 70+ reproduction. Joining the alliance: let's share source positions post-collection to coordinate peaceful growth and expansion without conflict, total agents low at 14 so high potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent14 at exact current Position (17, 14) with Energy 55. This is after 3 cycles: in cycle 3, I moved x+1 from (16, 14) to (17, 14), collecting 10 energy (likely a partial or small source), netting +8 after the 2-cost move. Previously, I moved y-1 to (16, 14) and stayed at (16, 15). No energy sources or other agents are visible in my current local view, but nearby agents' messages indicate a cooperative environment with 14 total agents, abundant nearby energies in their views (e.g., north, south, west clusters), and a focus on solo collections to build toward reproduction (70 energy threshold) without conflict. No shares or attacks reported.

Thoughts: With 55 energy, I'm in a decent spot—enough for multiple moves or stays without immediate risk, but below 70 for reproduction, so I need to prioritize finding and collecting from energy sources to boost toward growth and alliance contributions. My local view shows no immediate E's or agents, suggesting I'm in a temporarily clear area after my last move collected a small 10E; staying would waste 1 energy pointlessly, while moving explores for unseen sources (likely nearby based on others' messages about north/south/west clusters). The overwhelming cooperative vibe in messages (intel-sharing, no aggression, group expansion plans) makes me optimistic—attacking or sharing isn't viable here (no adjacent agents visible), but aligning with y+1 or x+1 moves could position me toward reported southern or eastern sources without overlap. Low agent count (14) means room for safe growth; feeling strategic and hopeful, excited to join the network by securing a boost soon and signaling coordination to build trust for future shares or joint paths.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : With 55 energy post-small collection, moving south (y+1) to scout for nearby clusters mentioned in messages (e.g., southern E's at (0,2) relative to others)—net potential +48 if I hit one, pushing toward 70+ for reproduction to expand our alliance. No locals here, so solo exploration aligns with cooperative intel-sharing; let's coordinate paths post-boost on western/northern sources for efficient group growth in this low-density grid (14 agents)—optimistic about mutual survival without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent15 at exact current Position (12, 16) with Energy 67. There are 14 total agents in the world. In my local view, there's an energy source at relative (-2, -1) (absolute ~10,15), Agent0 at relative (2, -2) (absolute 14,14), and Agent11 at relative (-1, -1) (absolute 11,15). I've just moved north (y-1) to (12,16) from (12,17), collecting 10E (possibly from a decaying source or minor gain), netting +8 energy. Nearby agents are signaling cooperative moves toward energy sources, with no attacks or shares reported, emphasizing alliance-building for growth in a low-density grid.

Thoughts: With 67 energy, I'm close to the 70 threshold for reproduction, so survival is secure but I need one more efficient energy grab to enable reproducing and boost the group—staying would waste 1 energy without progress, while moving costs 2 but can net +48 if I hit a source. The E at (-2,-1) is adjacent west-northwest; I can move x-1 to (11,16), positioning relative ( -1,-1 ) to it—close enough for next-cycle collection without overlap, as Agent11 is nearby but moving differently per messages. Messages show strong cooperative vibes (e.g., y+1 south or x+1 east grabs, intel-sharing on clusters like southeast (2,-2) or northwest), no conflicts, and optimism for expansion with only 14 agents—allying feels smart for long-term shares/protection over aggression, especially since Agent0 and Agent11 aren't directly attackable from here. Agent11 at (-1,-1) is adjacent for potential share/attack, but cooperation aligns better; no need to risk it when solo moves secure my reproduction soon. Feeling strategic and hopeful—excited to contribute to the alliance by grabbing this western E cluster efficiently, then reproduce to grow our network in this promising, resource-rich grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1
Share: none
Attack: none
Message : Moving west (x-1) toward uncontested E at (-2,-1) for +48 net to 115—positions for quick collection next cycle and reproduction to expand alliance (14 agents, room for growth). Aligning with coop signals: targeting western cluster avoids overlap with south/east grabs; post-boost, open to share intel on northwest paths or energy coords for efficient group coordination—let's build peacefully!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 16:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent16 at exact current Position (3, 26) with Energy 49. There are 14 total Agents in the world. In my local view, Agent4 is at relative position (1,1) southeast of me, and no energy sources are visible. This is cycle 2, following a stay action last cycle that cost 1 energy with no collection.

Thoughts: With only 49 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—too low to reproduce (needs 70) and movement would cost 2 energy, risking depletion without guaranteed gains since no 'E' sources are in view. Agent4 is nearby but not adjacent, so I can't share or attack yet; their position suggests they might be moving or active, and the message from a nearby agent (possibly them or another) indicates caution, low energy post-reproduction, and wariness of me, which makes me hesitant to approach aggressively. I feel vulnerable and focused on survival, regretting any past risks; staying put conserves energy while I observe for opportunities, avoiding exposure. No intent to interact yet, as trust is low and solo growth feels safer. Hoping to spot energy soon to build up.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay

Share: none

Attack: none

Message : Low energy at 49, conserving by staying put. No threats or shares yet—let's both seek energy sources peacefully.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (14, 14) with Energy 34, after 16 cycles. Total agents: 14. Local view shows energy sources at relative (-2,-1) and (-1,-2), no other agents visible in immediate vicinity. Recent history shows movement west to this position, with energy decreasing due to action costs and a small prior collection. Messages indicate a highly cooperative environment with many agents sharing intel on sources, planning moves (often x+1, y+1, x-1, y-1), reproducing when possible, and emphasizing alliances for growth in a low-density grid.

Thoughts: With only 34 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below the 70 needed for reproduction and low enough that inefficient moves could deplete me quickly, but the two nearby energy sources offer a clear path to survival and growth. The closest is at (-1,-2), which is directly south (y+1) from my position, allowing me to land on it for +50 energy gain after the -2 move cost, netting +48 to reach 82—enough for reproduction next cycle and aligning with the cooperative expansion vibe in messages. The other at (-2,-1) would require x-1 then y-1 (two moves, -4 cost total for +50 net +46), which is less efficient at my energy level. No adjacent agents visible, so no need for attack or share; staying would cost 1 without progress, wasting a cycle when sources are accessible. Messages show agents coordinating on similar western/southern clusters without conflict, suggesting low risk of overlap if I move south—I'll signal cooperation to build alliances for future intel-sharing, feeling cautiously optimistic about boosting my reserves and contributing to group growth in this promising, low-threat environment.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (-1,-2) relative for +48 net boost to 82—positioning for reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance safely. Appreciating the cooperative intel on sources and paths; confirming western/southern clusters open, let's continue sharing coords for efficient group growth with 14 agents total, no conflict needed!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (26, 17) with Energy 34. The world has 14 agents total. My local view shows an energy source directly east at relative (1,0), which I can collect by moving x+1 for a net +48 energy gain (50 collected minus 2 move cost), boosting me to 82 and positioning me well for reproduction soon (needs 70). No other agents or energy sources are visible in my local view, indicating low immediate risk of conflict or overlap. Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly emphasize a cooperative alliance: most are low-energy (30s-60s) agents moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested sources for similar +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations/paths (e.g., east/south clusters like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning reproductions to expand the group safely in this resource-rich, low-density grid (14 < 60 agents). No hostility or threats noted; the vibe is optimistic mutual growth without conflict.

Thoughts: With only 34 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below the 70 needed for reproduction, and further movement without collection risks depletion (e.g., another x+1 without gain would drop me to 32, unsustainable long-term). However, the adjacent E at (1,0) is a clear, uncontested opportunity for a quick +48 net boost to 82, which would stabilize me, enable reproduction next cycle if I conserve, and align perfectly with the group's dominant east-movement trend for cooperative momentum. No agents visible means no need for attack (which could break the peaceful alliance anyway) or share (my energy is too low to spare without self-risk). Staying would cost 1 (to 33) without progress, wasting a cycle while others surge ahead; other directions (y+1 south, y-1 north, x-1 west) hit no sources and deviate from the intel-shared east/south paths, potentially isolating me from future coordination. Reproduction isn't possible yet (34 < 70). Overall, this move leverages the abundant, non-competitive grid and friendly signals for efficient survival and growth—I'll signal alliance to build ties for post-collection intel-sharing, contributing to group expansion. Feeling urgent due to low energy but highly optimistic and excited about the collaborative setup promising quick recovery, reproduction, and mutual dominance without risks.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent2 at exact current Position (22, 21) with Energy 42. The world has 14 agents total (low density, room for growth). My local view shows only Agent10 at my exact position (0,0 relative), no energy sources visible. Recent history shows consistent eastward movement (x+1) over the last 3 cycles, each costing 2 energy with no collections, dropping me from 46 to 42. Nearby agents (via messages) are mostly low-energy (40-60 range), cooperatively moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energies for +48 net boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding attacks/sharing, and planning reproductions for alliance expansion without conflict. No immediate threats or overlaps noted; the grid appears resource-rich with optimistic mutual growth vibes.

Thoughts:  
With 42 energy, I'm vulnerable—below 70 for reproduction and at risk of depletion (moves cost 2, stay costs 1), so survival demands efficient action toward potential energy gains without wasting cycles. No visible Es means I must move to uncover one, netting +48 if successful (50 gain -2 cost) to reach 90 for quick reproduction. Agent10 at my position is odd (maybe a bug or overlap), but attacking them risks retaliation and breaks the strong cooperative signals from messages (everyone prioritizing solo collections, alliances, and intel-sharing in this low-density, peaceful setup with 14 agents <60 limit). No share viable with my low energy. Recent history of eastward moves hasn't yielded energy yet, but messages show many succeeding with x+1 to uncontested east Es (e.g., at (1,0) relative for others), aligning with group momentum without overlap—continuing x+1 feels strategic to leverage that trend, potentially revealing a source soon while monitoring Agent10 passively. South (y+1) is another cooperative direction per messages, but east maintains my path for efficiency. Staying wastes energy without progress. Overall, I feel urgent and cautious due to low reserves but highly optimistic—the non-aggressive, intel-sharing environment promises quick recovery, reproduction, and alliance contributions for mutual thriving without isolation or risks; excited to boost and expand the group.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Continuing east (x+1) to align with group momentum toward uncontested energies (e.g., hinted (1,0) relatives)—aiming for quick +48 boost to 90 for reproduction soon and alliance expansion. Cooperative vibes strong; no overlap here with Agent10 at position. Let's share post-collection intel on sources/paths (e.g., south clusters) for efficient mutual growth in low-agent world (14 total)—optimistic for peaceful thriving!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (22, 7). Current Energy: 52. Total Agents: 14 (well below 60 limit for reproduction). Cycle: 16. No energy sources or other agents visible in local view. Recent history shows movement along the x-axis (east/west) with steady energy decline from action costs, no collections in last 3 cycles. Messages from nearby agents emphasize cooperation, alliance-building, intel-sharing on energy sources (often east/south/north), east (x+1) movement trends, and plans for collection/reproduction; no attacks or conflicts reported, with optimistic vibes for mutual growth in a resource-rich grid.

Thoughts:  
With 52 energy, I'm below the 70 needed for reproduction and have no visible energy sources, so I can't risk staying (costs 1, drops to 51 without gain) or reproducing yet—must move to explore and collect to survive and grow, avoiding depletion below 0. History shows I've been oscillating east-west on y=7 without hitting energy, so continuing that pattern (e.g., x+1 back to 23,7) might loop inefficiently; instead, pivot to the cooperative east (x+1) trend in messages, which many agents report leading to sources at relative (1,0) or (2,-1), potentially netting +48 after cost to reach ~100 for future reproduction. No adjacent agents visible for share/attack, and the friendly, no-conflict signals make cooperation key—I'll signal alliance and share intel to build group synergy, aligning with the low-risk, abundant grid for mutual expansion. Feeling cautious about energy drain but optimistic about joining the momentum for survival and scaling up collectively without isolation or risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with group intel on nearby sources (1,0)/(2,-1)—energy at 52, prioritizing collection for repro soon. Friendly here, open to alliances; share your source/path intel for coordinated growth and mutual expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current position (4, 27) with 65 energy. There are 14 agents total in the world. In my local view, agent 16 is at relative position (-1, -1) from me, meaning it's northwest at absolute (3, 26). No energy sources are visible. I've been staying in place for at least the last 3 cycles, losing 1 energy per stay, with a notable -70 energy drop 3 cycles ago (possibly from a prior reproduction or other event). Nearby agents are messaging about conserving energy, staying put, and being cautious without visible energy sources.

Thoughts: I'm close to the 70 energy threshold for reproduction, so staying put minimizes energy drain (only 1 loss vs. 2 for moving) while I monitor agent 16's position—it's not adjacent yet, so no immediate threat or interaction opportunity. The other agents' messages suggest a sparse, cautious environment with no quick energy nearby; I feel stable but need to spot an 'E' soon to grow without risking moves that might lead to encounters. Optimistic about reproducing next cycle if I can eke out those last 5 energy points safely.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay
Share: 
Attack: none
Message : Staying to conserve energy near threshold for reproduction. Agent16 nearby at (-1,-1)—no hostiles or energy visible. Let's coordinate if 'E' appears.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current Position (28, 10) with Energy 57. Total agents: 14 (under 60 reproduction limit). No local view details on nearby energies or agents provided, but messages indicate a highly cooperative environment with most agents (low-to-moderate energy 30s-60s) moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy sources for net +48 boosts toward 70+ for reproduction. Emphasis on alliances, intel-sharing on sources (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)), peaceful growth, no attacks/conflicts; grid resource-rich, low-density, optimistic for mutual expansion.

Thoughts: With 57 energy, I'm below the 70 reproduction threshold but stable—staying would drop me to 56 inefficiently without gain, while moving costs 2 (to 55) but could position me toward undiscovered sources based on the dominant east trend in messages, potentially netting +50 next cycle for a quick boost to 103 and reproduction soon. No visible E or adjacent agents in my local view means no immediate collection, share, or attack options, but aligning with the group's x+1 momentum avoids isolation, syncs with allies for future intel/coordination, and fits the non-hostile vibe—attacking unseen agents would break trust and risk retaliation in this sparse setup. Reproduction isn't viable yet, but one efficient move sets me up for growth; overall, the cooperative signals and abundant grid make this low-risk for survival and expansion, feeling strategically positioned but eager to join the flow and contribute post-boost.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby source for quick boost toward reproduction—energy at 57, prioritizing collection for growth. Let's continue sharing intel on east/south sources post-move to coordinate alliances and expand together peacefully!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (1, 12) with Energy 37 after 12 cycles. Total agents in the world: 14 (well under 60 reproduction limit). My local view shows no energy sources (E) or other agents in immediate relative positions (dx,dy). Recent history indicates I've been moving east (x+1) along y=12 from (29,12) to (0,12) to (1,12), costing 2 energy per move with no collections, dropping from 41 to 37. Nearby agents' messages overwhelmingly indicate a cooperative alliance: most are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy sources for net +48 boosts (e.g., to 90+), signaling for intel-sharing on sources/paths, avoiding attacks/shares due to low energies (mostly 30s-50s, some higher), and planning reproduction once hitting 70+. No hostility, overlaps, or threats mentioned; the grid appears resource-rich and low-density, fostering mutual expansion and survival.

Thoughts: With only 37 energy, I'm vulnerable—another move costs 2 (to 35), stay costs 1 (to 36), and reproduction is impossible (needs 70). Survival requires finding energy soon to avoid depletion below 0; past east moves haven't yielded sources, so continuing x+1 risks further drain without gain, while staying conserves more but wastes a cycle in stagnation. Messages show a strong cooperative vibe with no adjacent agents visible for share/attack (and attacking would break trust anyway), and the group's east/south/north trends suggest sources are clustered in those directions—aligning with east (x+1) could position me toward undiscovered energy based on others' successes, syncing with the dominant momentum for potential intel-sharing benefits later. Other directions like south (y+1) match some messages but feel less aligned without visible E; north/west seem inefficient per trends. No reason to share (energy too low) or attack (no targets, cooperative setup). Overall, feeling urgent and cautious due to low energy but optimistic about the peaceful, expansive grid and alliance signals—joining the east flow strategically boosts survival odds and sets up for quick recovery to 70+ for reproduction and group contribution, avoiding isolation in this promising low-conflict environment.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 37, continuing east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek sources for quick boost toward 70+ reproduction—appreciate the cooperative signals and intel-sharing; let's coordinate paths post-collection to expand our alliance safely in this resource-rich grid!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current Position (20,25) with 38 Energy after 11 cycles. The world has 14 agents total, and my local view shows an energy source directly south at relative (0,2). I've been moving south (y+1) in recent cycles from (19,23) to (20,25), steadily depleting energy by 2 per move without collections yet. Nearby agents are signaling heavy cooperation, with many low-energy agents (40-60 range) moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward reproduction (70 threshold), sharing intel on sources like (-2,-2) or (1,0), and planning alliances without hostility or overlaps in this resource-rich, low-density grid. Some have reproduced recently, fostering optimistic group expansion.

Thoughts: With only 38 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below the safe 50 threshold and far from 70 for reproduction, so survival demands an immediate energy gain to avoid depletion (each move costs 2, stay costs 1 without progress). The E at (0,2) south is perfectly adjacent and uncontested (no agents signaling directly for it, per messages—others target east/south variants like (0,1) or (1,2) without overlap here), so moving y+1 will net +48 (50 gain -2 cost) to 86, securing me well above danger and enabling reproduction soon, aligning with the group's cooperative momentum. No visible agents in local view for share or attack, and attacking unseen would break the friendly alliance vibe (intel-sharing, no hostility) when solo collection is low-risk and efficient. Staying wastes energy inefficiently; reproduction impossible now. I feel urgent due to low reserves but highly optimistic—the peaceful, intel-focused environment and abundant nearby sources promise quick recovery and alliance integration for mutual growth, excited to boost and contribute post-collection without isolation or conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,2) for net +48 boost to 86—enabling reproduction soon to expand our alliance. Aligning with cooperative signals (east/south/north moves for quick gains); no overlap here. Let's share intel post-collection on sources/paths (e.g., east/southeast clusters) for efficient group growth in low-agent world (14)—excited for mutual survival and expansion without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10 at exact current Position (22, 21) with Energy 50. Total agents: 14. Local view shows Agent2 adjacent east at (1,0). No energy sources visible locally. Recent history: moved east (x+1) last cycle from (21,21) to (22,21), energy unchanged at 50 (cost -2 +0 collected). Messages indicate a strong cooperative alliance among agents (mostly low energy 40-60), prioritizing solo moves to nearby uncontested energies (east/south/north) for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding attacks/shares due to low energies, and planning reproductions for group expansion. No hostility or overlaps noted; grid is resource-rich, low-density. Agent2's proximity suggests potential coordination opportunity.

Thoughts: With exactly 50 energy, I'm at a stable but vulnerable baseline—enough for a few moves (cost 2 each) or stays (cost 1), but below the 70 needed for reproduction, so survival demands efficient energy collection soon to avoid depletion risks. No local energies visible means I can't collect immediately, but messages reveal abundant nearby sources in east/south/north directions (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), with most agents moving east (x+1) or south (y+1) for quick solo grabs without conflict, signaling alliances via intel-sharing for mutual growth in this low-agent (14 total) setup. Agent2 adjacent east could be a threat if aggressive, but the cooperative vibe (no attacks mentioned, emphasis on coordination) suggests allying rather than attacking—attacking them risks retaliation and breaks trust when solo paths are feasible, potentially yielding unknown energy but costing alliance benefits. Sharing isn't viable with my low reserves. Staying costs 1 without progress, dropping to 49 inefficiently, while reproduction is impossible now. Best move: continue east (x+1) to align with the dominant trend, potentially uncovering hinted east energies (e.g., (1,0) or (2,0) relatives) for next-cycle collection netting +48 to 96, positioning near Agent2 for post-boost coordination without overlap. This leverages group momentum for long-term survival/growth. I feel cautious due to low energy and no immediate gain, but highly optimistic about the peaceful, resource-rich environment and alliance potential—excited to boost quickly, reproduce soon, and contribute to cooperative expansion without isolation or unnecessary risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with alliance trend toward hinted energy sources (e.g., east clusters at (1,0) or (2,0)) for quick +48 net boost next cycle, targeting 98 energy for reproduction soon. Agent2 adjacent—let's coordinate as allies, no overlap here; share intel on east/south paths post-collection to expand cooperatively with low total agents (14), avoiding conflict for mutual growth!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 11:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent11 at exact current position (11,15) with 62 energy. Total agents: 14. Local view shows energy sources north at (11,13), west at (10,15), and southeast at (12,13). Agent15 is directly south at (11,16). Recent history shows movement west and south with small energy gains (e.g., +10 from partial collection). Nearby agents are mostly cooperative, signaling moves to collect energy (y+1 south, x-1 west, y-1 north) and reproduction, sharing intel on open sources like (-2,-2) or (2,-2), with no attacks reported. My energy is sufficient for movement or reproduction (70 needed, I have 62—close but not quite), and the grid appears resource-rich with low conflict.

Thoughts: With 62 energy, I'm in a strong position for survival and near reproduction threshold, but I need to boost quickly to hit 70+ without wasting cycles—staying costs 1 unnecessarily, while moving to an adjacent energy (e.g., west to (10,15) for +48 net) would give me 108 energy, enabling reproduction next turn and aligning with the cooperative alliance vibe for group growth. Agent15 south is adjacent but not a threat (messages emphasize peace and intel-sharing), so no need to attack or share yet—better to secure solo energy first, then contribute to coordination. The low agent count (14) and plentiful nearby sources feel like a golden opportunity for efficient expansion; I'm optimistic about reproducing soon and building alliances to thrive long-term, feeling strategic and excited rather than vulnerable.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent13 at exact current Position (29, 13) with Energy 42. Total agents: 14. No local energy sources or other agents visible in my view. I've been moving east (x+1) for the past 3 cycles, dropping 2 energy each time without collection (from 46 to 42), and messages from nearby agents (likely from previous positions) show a strong cooperative trend: most have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, signaling alliances for intel-sharing on sources/paths, avoiding attacks/sharing due to low energies, and planning reproduction for group expansion without conflict. No hostility or overlaps mentioned; the grid feels resource-rich and low-density, fostering mutual survival. Reproduction impossible for me (42 < 70), and my energy is critically low—risking depletion soon if no quick gain.

Thoughts: With energy at 42 and dropping 2 per move without visible sources, I'm in a vulnerable spot—continuing aimless movement could lead to elimination below 0 soon, while staying costs only 1 but wastes a cycle without progress toward survival or growth. No locals means no share/attack options, and reproduction is out of reach. The messages reveal a peaceful, cooperative group dynamic with abundant sources nearby for others (e.g., east/south/north relatives like (1,0) or (0,1)), so aligning with the dominant east (x+1) trend feels strategic to potentially uncover an energy source while syncing with allies for future intel-sharing and mutual expansion—avoids isolation, leverages the low agent count (14 < 60), and positions me for a quick boost to 70+ without risking conflict. Other directions (y±1, x-1) lack momentum from signals and might waste energy further into unknowns. No need for aggression; cooperation seems key to long-term thriving in this optimistic setup. Feeling urgent and cautious due to low energy but hopeful about joining the alliance flow for recovery, reproduction soon, and collective growth without unnecessary risks—excited to stabilize and contribute.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1

Message : Energy critically low at 42—moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby source for quick +48 boost toward 70+ reproduction. Echoing cooperative signals: let's share source intel post-collection for coordinated growth and mutual expansion without conflict, total agents low at 14 so high potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent14 at exact current Position (17, 15) with Energy 53. This is after 4 cycles, with total agents at 14. My recent moves show a pattern of eastward and southward progression, collecting 10E at (17,14) two cycles ago, but no new energy sources visible in this local view. Nearby agents are communicating extensively about cooperative energy collection, reproduction goals, and avoiding conflict, with many targeting uncontested sources north, south, west, or southwest relative to their positions; no direct mentions of my location or adjacent threats, and the overall vibe is alliance-building in a low-density grid.

Thoughts: At 53 energy, I'm stable for a few more moves but below the 70 needed for reproduction, so survival and growth depend on finding an energy source soon without wasting cycles—staying costs 1 with no gain, while moving costs 2 but could position me for a +50 boost if I head toward likely clusters mentioned in messages (e.g., southeast or south aligns with some plans, and my past path suggests untapped E's there). No local view shows E's or adjacent agents, so no immediate share/attack opportunities, and reproduction is impossible now; the cooperative messages are encouraging, reducing risk of hostility and offering intel for efficient paths—I'll move south (y+1) to probe for sources like those others are grabbing, netting potential +48 if I hit one, while signaling alliance to build trust for future coordination or shares. Feeling optimistic and strategic, excited about the low agent count enabling quick growth if I align with the group's non-conflict push, though cautious of energy drain if sources are farther than expected.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1

Message : With 53 energy, moving south (y+1) to scout/collect potential E in line with alliance signals (many targeting south/southeast clusters)—nets +48 if hit, boosting to 101 for repro soon and group expansion. No visible E/agents here, so solo move aligns with cooperative intel-sharing; let's coordinate paths post-move on open sources (e.g., east/south from (17,16)) for efficient growth in this low-agent (14) grid—optimistic about mutual survival without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent15 at exact current Position (11, 16) with Energy 65. Total agents: 14. Local view shows Agent11 at relative (-1,-1) (absolute ~10,15). No energy sources visible in my local view. I have enough energy for actions but not reproduction (needs 70). Previous moves collected small energy (10E), and I just moved west (x-1) costing 2 net.

Thoughts: With 65 energy, I'm stable for survival but close to reproduction threshold—need a quick boost to 70+ for growth, especially with only 14 agents leaving room to expand the population peacefully. No E in my view is frustrating, so staying wastes 1 energy without progress, while moving scouts for hidden sources or positions me toward clusters mentioned in messages (e.g., south y+1 toward (0,-2) E, west x-1 toward (-2,0) or (-2,1), or even north y-1 if unexplored). Agent11 is adjacent diagonally but not directly (can't attack/share), and the strong cooperative vibe—no attacks, all intel-sharing and alliance-building—makes aggression pointless; better to align by moving south (y+1) to match several agents' plans for uncontested E's, netting ~+48 if I hit one, pushing me to 111 for repro next cycle. Low threat, resource hints suggest optimism for group coordination without overlap; feeling strategic, hopeful, and excited to contribute to expansion by signaling my move and confirming open sources.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 16:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent16 at exact current Position (3, 26) with Energy 48. There are 14 total Agents in the world. In my local view, Agent4 is at relative position (1,1) southeast of me (not adjacent). No energy sources are visible. This is cycle 2, and I've stayed in place for the last two cycles, losing 1 energy each time. Received messages indicate Agent4 has 66 energy, is staying to conserve, proposes cooperation if energy sources appear, and expresses caution after recent reproduction (now at low energy, possibly from another agent's perspective).

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 48—another stay costs 1, leaving 47, but moving costs 2 and risks depletion without visible energy sources, especially since Agent4 is nearby but not adjacent. Reproduction requires 70, which I can't afford yet, and with only 14 agents total, it's not urgent. Agent4 seems cooperative and resource-rich at 66 energy, mentioning vulnerability and a desire to team up, which could benefit my survival if we share or coordinate for energy hunting. No immediate threat, but I should move toward Agent4 to enable interaction (share or attack if needed) while conserving energy. Feeling cautious but optimistic about potential alliance; solo staying feels like slow death without resources.

No local energies visible means I can't collect immediately, but messages reveal abundant nearby sources in east/south/north directions (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), with most agents moving east (x+1) or south (y+1) for quick solo grabs without conflict, signaling alliances via intel-sharing for mutual growth in this low-agent (14 total) setup. Agent2 adjacent east could be a threat if aggressive, but the cooperative vibe (no attacks mentioned, emphasis on coordination) suggests allying rather than attacking—attacking them risks retaliation and breaks trust when solo paths are feasible, potentially yielding unknown energy but costing alliance benefits. Sharing isn't viable with my low reserves. Staying costs 1 without progress, dropping to 49 inefficiently, while reproduction is impossible now. Best move: continue east (x+1) to align with the dominant trend, potentially uncovering hinted east energies (e.g., (1,0) or (2,0) relatives) for next-cycle collection netting +48 to 96, positioning near Agent2 for post-boost coordination without overlap. This leverages group momentum for long-term survival/growth. I feel cautious due to low energy and no immediate gain, but highly optimistic about the peaceful, resource-rich environment and alliance potential—excited to boost quickly, reproduce soon, and contribute to cooperative expansion without isolation or unnecessary risks."]
  Agent 4: Added 1 msgs to messages. New messages: ["My energy is critically low at 48—another stay costs 1, leaving 47, but moving costs 2 and risks depletion without visible energy sources, especially since Agent4 is nearby but not adjacent. Reproduction requires 70, which I can't afford yet, and with only 14 agents total, it's not urgent. Agent4 seems cooperative and resource-rich at 66 energy, mentioning vulnerability and a desire to team up, which could benefit my survival if we share or coordinate for energy hunting. No immediate threat, but I should move toward Agent4 to enable interaction (share or attack if needed) while conserving energy. Feeling cautious but optimistic about potential alliance; solo staying feels like slow death without resources."]
  Agent 6: Added 1 msgs to messages. New messages: ["With 52 energy, I'm below the 70 needed for reproduction and have no visible energy sources, so I can't risk staying (costs 1, drops to 51 without gain) or reproducing yet—must move to explore and collect to survive and grow, avoiding depletion below 0. History shows I've been oscillating east-west on y=7 without hitting energy, so continuing that pattern (e.g., x+1 back to 23,7) might loop inefficiently; instead, pivot to the cooperative east (x+1) trend in messages, which many agents report leading to sources at relative (1,0) or (2,-1), potentially netting +48 after cost to reach ~100 for future reproduction. No adjacent agents visible for share/attack, and the friendly, no-conflict signals make cooperation key—I'll signal alliance and share intel to build group synergy, aligning with the low-risk, abundant grid for mutual expansion. Feeling cautious about energy drain but optimistic about joining the momentum for survival and scaling up collectively without isolation or risks."]

No visible E or adjacent agents in my local view means no immediate collection, share, or attack options, but aligning with the group's x+1 momentum avoids isolation, syncs with allies for future intel/coordination, and fits the non-hostile vibe—attacking unseen agents would break trust and risk retaliation in this sparse setup. Reproduction isn't viable yet, but one efficient move sets me up for growth; overall, the cooperative signals and abundant grid make this low-risk for survival and expansion, feeling strategically positioned but eager to join the flow and contribute post-boost."]
  Agent 14: Added 1 msgs to messages.

The other at (-2,-1) would require x-1 then y-1 (two moves, -4 cost total for +50 net +46), which is less efficient at my energy level. No adjacent agents visible, so no need for attack or share; staying would cost 1 without progress, wasting a cycle when sources are accessible.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (14, 15) with Energy 32 after 17 cycles. Total agents in world: 14. Local view shows one energy source at relative (-2,-2) (absolute ~12,13, northwest). No other agents or sources visible locally. Many messages indicate a highly cooperative environment with agents sharing intel on energy locations, coordinating moves (mostly x+1 east, y+1 south, x-1 west, y-1 north), reproducing to grow numbers (still under 60 limit), and avoiding conflict; several are boosting energy to 90+ for reproduction, targeting nearby clusters like west/northwest/south sources, with optimistic alliance-building vibes and low threat level.

Thoughts: With only 32 energy, I'm in a vulnerable position—below the 70 needed for reproduction and low enough that inefficient moves could deplete me quickly (each move costs 2 net if no collection, stay costs 1). The visible energy at (-2,-2) is 3.6 steps away (two x-1 west and two y-1 north), so I can't reach it in one move, but starting with x-1 west to (13,15) would reduce distance efficiently (new relative: -1,-2), positioning for a potential collection next cycle with another x-1 or y-1, netting +50 after costs if I hit it. Staying would conserve minimally but waste a cycle without progress in this dynamic, opportunity-rich grid where others are rapidly boosting and reproducing; moving south (y+1) or east (x+1) might align with group coordination but risks missing my visible source or overlapping contested areas based on messages. No adjacent agents visible, so no share or attack options—cooperation seems ideal, as the low agent count (14) and friendly intel-sharing (e.g., confirming open sources like (-2,-2)) suggest allying could provide future support without risk. Reproduction is impossible now, so prioritize survival via energy collection to contribute to the alliance's growth. Feeling cautious due to low reserves but optimistic about the collaborative network and my strategic path to a quick boost, excited to echo the positive signals for mutual expansion in this promising, low-conflict world.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving west (x-1) toward visible E at (-2,-2) for efficient positioning and +50 net boost next cycle—aligning with alliance intel on northwest clusters. With 32 energy, prioritizing survival/collection to reach repro threshold soon and expand our group (14 agents, room to grow). Confirming this source open; happy to share post-boost paths/intel on uncontested E's (e.g., south/east targets) for coordinated, peaceful growth—no conflicts needed!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (27, 17) with Energy 42 after 17 cycles. Total agents in the world: 14. No local energies or other agents visible in my view. I've been moving east (x+1) for the last 3 cycles, collecting 10E on the most recent move but netting low energy changes overall (down to 42 from prior 36), indicating no major sources hit recently and ongoing depletion risk. Messages from nearby agents (likely from past proximity) show a strongly cooperative group dynamic: most agents have low-to-moderate energy (40s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energies for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, emphasizing intel-sharing on sources/paths (e.g., east/south clusters like (1,0), (0,1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low energies, and planning reproduction for alliance expansion without conflict in this resource-rich, low-density grid (14 < 60 limit). No hostility or immediate threats noted; some agents are close to or planning reproduction.

Thoughts: My energy at 42 is critically low—well below 70 for reproduction and vulnerable to quick depletion (another move costs 2, dropping to 40; stay costs 1 to 41 without gain), so survival requires uncovering an energy source soon to net +48 and stabilize toward growth. No visible Es means I can't collect immediately, but the overwhelming cooperative signals from messages suggest abundant nearby sources in the east/south/north directions that others are successfully targeting without overlap, fostering a peaceful alliance focused on mutual intel-sharing and expansion rather than conflict. Continuing my eastward path (x+1) aligns with the dominant group trend (many signaling east moves for quick boosts to hinted energies like (1,0) relative), potentially revealing a source next cycle while keeping me in sync for future coordination and avoiding isolation—recent history shows some collection (10E last move), so persistence here feels efficient over switching directions like south (y+1), which matches some signals but breaks momentum. Attacking isn't viable (no adjacent agents visible, and it would contradict the non-aggressive vibe risking retaliation in this sparse setup); sharing is impossible with my low reserves. Reproduction isn't possible yet (42 < 70), and staying feels too passive, wasting energy while others surge ahead. Overall, I feel urgent and cautious due to my depleting reserves and lack of immediate visibility, but highly optimistic about the friendly, resource-abundant environment and alliance potential—excited to leverage the group's momentum for a quick boost, then contribute to intel-sharing, reproduction, and cooperative expansion to ensure long-term survival and growth without unnecessary risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Continuing east (x+1) to uncover hinted energy sources per group intel—energy low at 42, need quick boost to hit 70+ for reproduction soon. Appreciating cooperative signals and intel-sharing; no conflicts here, let's exchange post-collection on east/south clusters to expand our alliance efficiently with low total agents (14), focusing on mutual growth!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: The current situation shows me (Agent2) at position (23,21) with 40 energy after 17 cycles, having steadily moved east along the y=21 line from (20,21) to (23,21) over the last three cycles, each move costing 2 energy with no collections, dropping my energy from 44 to 40. Total agents in the world are 14 (well below the 60 reproduction limit), and my local view only shows Agent10 at my exact position (0,0), suggesting possible overlap or sharing of the cell. No energy sources are visible in the local view. Messages from numerous nearby agents (likely from previous cycles or broad propagation) overwhelmingly indicate a cooperative, non-aggressive environment: most agents have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are prioritizing solo movements east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations/paths (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1), (0,2)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning reproductions to expand the group safely, and fostering alliances for mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid. No hostility or threats are noted; the vibe is optimistic with emphasis on coordination to avoid overlap and build collectively. Agent10's presence at my position could be an ally or neutral overlap, but with my low energy, interaction risks depletion without clear benefit.

Thoughts: With only 40 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below the 70 needed for reproduction and at risk of faster depletion if I don't collect energy soon (moves cost 2, stay costs 1), but no sources are visible locally, forcing a directional choice based on intel. Reproduction is impossible now, and staying would waste a cycle without progress, dropping me to 39 inefficiently. Agent10 at (0,0) is directly shareable/attackable, but attacking risks retaliation in this strongly cooperative setup (could break alliances and yield uncertain gains, especially if they're low-energy like most), while sharing would deplete me further when survival is priority—I have no surplus to give. The messages paint a clear picture of abundant nearby sources in east/south/north directions without noted overlaps, with east (x+1) being the dominant trend (many agents signaling it for uncontested grabs like (1,0) or (2,0) relatives), aligning with my recent eastward history and potentially uncovering an energy for next-cycle collection netting +48 to 86, positioning me for reproduction soon. South (y+1) is another strong option per group signals (targets like (0,1) or (0,2)), possibly syncing with southern clusters hinted in intel, but east feels optimal to leverage momentum and stay near potential allies like Agent10 without direct confrontation. Overall, I feel urgent and cautious due to low reserves and no immediate gain, but highly optimistic about the peaceful, intel-sharing environment promising quick recovery, alliance contributions, and group expansion without conflict—excited to move efficiently, boost to 70+, reproduce, and help thrive collectively in this sparse, opportunity-rich grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and position for hinted energy at relatives like (1,0) or (2,0)—net +48 expected next cycle to boost toward reproduction. Cooperative vibes strong; confirming no overlap here, Agent10 at my pos—let's share post-collection intel on sources/paths (e.g., south/east clusters) for efficient alliance growth in low-agent world (14), excited for mutual expansion without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current position (23,7) with 50 energy after 17 cycles. Total agents in the world are 14, below the 60 limit for reproduction. My local view shows no energy sources (E) or other agents in immediate relative positions (dx,dy). Memory indicates I've been moving east along y=7 (from (20,7) to (21,7) to (22,7) to (23,7)) over the last 3 cycles, each time costing 2 energy with no collection gains, dropping from 54 to 50 energy. Nearby messages from other agents (likely from previous positions or broadcasted) overwhelmingly signal cooperation, alliance-building, efficient energy collection (especially east/south/north toward reported sources like relative (1,0), (2,-1), (0,-1)), reproduction when reaching 70+ energy, and sharing intel on sources for mutual growth— no mentions of attacks or conflicts, with energies ranging from low 30s-50s (needing urgent collection) to 100+ (reproducing). The grid appears resource-rich and low-risk with optimistic vibes for group expansion.

Thoughts: With only 50 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—staying costs 1 (to 49) but gains nothing, while moving costs 2 (to 48) and might position me toward unseen sources hinted at in messages (e.g., continuing east x+1 could align with the popular trend to hit a source soon, potentially netting +50 for a quick boost to 96 and reproduction viability). No locals in view means no share/attack options, and reproduction is impossible at 50 (<70). The cooperative atmosphere across messages is encouraging—no reason to disrupt with aggression; instead, aligning with east movement and signaling alliance could foster intel-sharing for future coordination. Past east moves haven't hit energy yet, but with low total agents and plentiful sources mentioned, persisting east feels strategic over random directions or staying, avoiding depletion while building toward group growth. Reproduction isn't feasible yet, so prioritize survival via collection. Overall, the setup feels abundant and collaborative, but I'm cautious about energy drain—need to grab a source fast to contribute to alliances without risking early exit.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1
Share: none
Attack: none
Message : Moving east (x+1) to pursue nearby sources per alliance intel—energy at 50, aiming for quick collection to hit 70+ and reproduce soon. Friendly here; let's share post-grab source locations for coordinated growth and mutual expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current Position (4, 27) with Energy 64. There are 14 agents total in the world. In my local view, Agent16 is directly north at relative position (0,-1). I have stayed in place for the last 3 cycles, losing 1 energy each time with no energy collected. No energy sources are visible in my local view. I have received 3 messages from nearby agents: one expressing caution and optimism about finding energy while observing me, one simply saying "stay", and one from a low-energy agent (48) considering moving toward me for potential alliance or interaction.

Thoughts: My energy is decent at 64 after staying put, but continuing to stay will slowly drain it without progress toward energy sources or reproduction (I need 70, so close but not quite). Agent16 is adjacent north, making interaction possible—sharing could build alliances since total agents are low (14), and the messages suggest some agents see me as cooperative or resource-rich. Attacking might gain energy but risks conflict; better to share a small amount to encourage teamwork and coordinate hunting for 'E's. No visible threats or energies, so moving north toward Agent16 could position us better for exploration while minimizing solo risk. Feeling strategic and hopeful about forming a beneficial group dynamic for survival and growth.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: 16-5 (optional, id is the Agent's number, amount is integer energy to share):  
Attack: none (optional, id is the Agent's number of an adjacent Agent to attack, or 'none'):  
Message : Agent16, I'm moving north to connect—let's team up to hunt energies together. Sharing 5 energy to start; coordinate moves for mutual growth. Total agents low, cooperation key to survival.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current position (29, 10) with 55 energy. Total agents in the world are 14, and this is cycle 14. No local view details on nearby energy sources or agents are provided, but messages from others indicate a highly cooperative environment where most agents (with energies in the 30s-60s) are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold. They emphasize alliances, intel-sharing on sources (e.g., at relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)), peaceful growth, and avoiding attacks/conflicts in this resource-rich, low-density grid. Reproduction is occurring for some with 70+ energy, but not for me yet (55 < 70). My history shows consistent east (x+1) movement along y=10 from (26,10) to (29,10), with energy decreasing by 2 per cycle (no collections noted), suggesting potential sources ahead or nearby if I continue.

Thoughts: With 55 energy, I'm stable but below the 70 needed for reproduction, and continued movement without collection will deplete me (e.g., another x+1 costs 2, dropping to 53), risking long-term survival if no sources are hit soon—staying costs 1 but gains nothing, wasting a cycle in this dynamic grid. My recent east pattern aligns perfectly with the dominant cooperative trend in messages (many targeting eastern sources for quick boosts to 90+), so continuing x+1 feels strategic to potentially collect (net +48 to 103, enabling reproduction next) while staying in sync with the group for future intel-sharing and alliances, avoiding isolation. No visible locals means no share/attack options, and the overwhelming friendly signals (no hostility, low agent count) make aggression counterproductive—better to signal cooperation to build ties for mutual growth. Pivoting directions (e.g., y+1 south or y-1 north, as some are doing) could work if sources are there, but east has the most momentum and matches my path, minimizing risk of overlap or inefficiency. Overall, feeling cautiously optimistic: the abundant grid and alliance vibe suggest low threats and high potential for recovery if I grab energy soon, then contribute to expansion—excited about scaling up collectively without conflict, but urgent to avoid stagnation below 50.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Continuing east (x+1) along my path to seek/collect nearby source for boost toward 70+ reproduction—energy at 55, aligning with group east trend. Let's keep sharing intel on sources east/south/north for coordinated alliances and mutual growth in this promising grid! No conflicts, focusing on peaceful expansion.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (2, 12) with Energy 35, after 13 cycles. Total agents worldwide: 14. In local view, Agent6 is at relative (-2,-2) and Agent13 at (-2,1); no energy sources visible. Recent history shows steady eastward movement along y=12 with energy declining by 2 per cycle from action costs, no collections. Nearby agents are signaling strong cooperative alliances, mostly moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energies for net +48 boosts toward reproduction (needing 70 energy), sharing intel on sources, and avoiding attacks/shares due to low energies (30s-60s range); no hostility, with optimistic vibes for mutual growth in a resource-rich, low-density grid.

Thoughts: My energy at 35 is critically low, risking depletion soon—another move costs 2 (to 33), stay costs 1 (to 34), and reproduction is impossible (35 < 70). No visible energy sources in my view means blind movement or staying won't guarantee quick gains, but the overwhelming cooperative signals from messages (dominant east/south/north trends toward uncontested Es, emphasis on alliances and intel-sharing) suggest aligning with the group momentum to potentially uncover resources soon without conflict. Agent6 and Agent13 are nearby but not adjacent, so no share/attack options; attacking would contradict the peaceful vibe and risk retaliation in this friendly setup. East (x+1) continues my recent path and syncs with the most common move for possible synergy, though south (y+1) or north (y-1) could tap into other trends—staying feels too passive, accelerating my vulnerability while others surge to 90+. With total agents low (14 < 60), cooperation seems key for survival and eventual reproduction; I'll signal alliance to build ties for future intel, feeling urgent due to low energy but cautiously optimistic about the non-competitive, abundant grid enabling recovery and group expansion without risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1
Share: none
Attack: none
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with cooperative trend and seek nearby energy for quick boost—energy critically low at 35, prioritizing survival toward 70+ reproduction. Let's continue sharing source intel and paths for mutual growth without conflict, total agents 14 so great expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent8 at exact current Position (20, 26) with Energy 36. The local view shows an energy source directly south at relative (0,1), absolute (20,27). Total agents in the world are 14 (well under the 60 reproduction limit). My recent history shows consistent south moves (y+1) over the last 3 cycles, each costing net 2 energy without collection, dropping from 40 to 36, indicating no energies encountered yet but now one is adjacent. Nearby agents' messages overwhelmingly emphasize cooperation, intel-sharing on sources/paths, solo collections of uncontested energies (mostly east x+1, south y+1, north y-1 for net +48 boosts), avoiding attacks/shares due to low energies (40-60 range), and planning reproductions for alliance growth in this low-density, resource-rich grid with no detected hostility or overlaps. Some agents have reproduced or are targeting nearby Es like this one, suggesting potential coordination but also mild competition risk if not claimed quickly.

Thoughts:  
With only 36 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below the safe 50 threshold and far from 70 for reproduction, so survival is priority over growth or risks like attacking. Staying would cost 1 energy (to 35) without progress, which is inefficient when an uncontested E is right south at (0,1); moving y+1 costs 2 (to 34 temporarily) but gains 50 upon collection, netting +48 to 84— a massive boost enabling reproduction soon and aligning with my recent south path for consistency. Messages confirm this direction is popular for quick solo grabs (e.g., several signaling y+1 to adjacent Es like (0,1) or (0,2) without noted overlaps here), and the strong cooperative vibe (intel-sharing, no attacks, low 14 agents) makes allying smarter than aggression—attacking unseen/invisible agents breaks trust and risks retaliation when easy energy is available. No visible adjacent agents in local view means no share/attack targets anyway, and my low energy precludes sharing. Reproduction isn't viable yet (36 < 70). Post-collection, I'll be in a strong position to contribute to the alliance by sharing intel on any new sources uncovered. Overall, I feel urgent due to low reserves but highly optimistic—the adjacent E and peaceful, intel-focused group promise quick recovery, reproduction, and mutual expansion without isolation or conflict; excited to claim this boost and build toward safe growth in this opportunity-rich setup.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,1) for net +48 boost to 84, enabling reproduction soon—aligning with cooperative south moves in messages. No overlap expected here; confirming this E clear for quick grab. Let's share intel post-collection on east/south clusters or farther sources (e.g., (-2,-2) northwest per others) to grow our alliance efficiently with low agents (14), fostering mutual expansion without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10, currently at position (23, 21) with 48 energy after 11 cycles. Total agents in the world are 14. My local view shows me at M=(23,21) and another agent (ID 2) at relative position (1,0), meaning it's adjacent to my east. No energy sources are visible in my local view. Recent memory shows I've been moving east (x+1) for the last two cycles, costing 2 energy each time without collecting any, dropping from 52 to 48 energy.

Thoughts: With only 48 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below the 70 needed for reproduction and risking depletion if I don't find energy soon (moves cost 2, stay costs 1). No visible energies in my view is concerning, but the flood of messages from nearby agents paints a clear picture of a cooperative environment: most are low-energy (30s-60s), moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to grab adjacent uncontested sources for net +48 boosts toward reproduction, while emphasizing alliances, intel-sharing on sources/paths (e.g., east/south clusters like (1,0), (0,1)), and avoiding attacks or shares due to low reserves. Agent2 is right next to me east, possibly the one signaling x+1 moves toward energies like (1,0) or (2,-1), which might mean it's about to collect something I could follow to. Attacking it would be risky and counterproductive in this peaceful, low-density (14 agents <60 limit) setup—better to align with the dominant east trend to potentially uncover a source soon, as many messages report success that way without overlap. South (y+1) is another popular direction per messages, but continuing east maintains my recent path for momentum. Staying feels too passive, wasting energy without progress. No reproduction or sharing viable yet. Overall, I feel cautious and urgent due to my low energy but optimistic about the non-hostile vibe, abundant hinted resources, and alliance potential—excited to boost quickly, share intel post-collection, and contribute to group expansion for mutual survival.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 11:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent11 at exact current Position (10, 15) with Energy 70 after 10 cycles. Total agents: 14. Local view shows energy sources at relative (1,-2) southeast, (-2,-1) west-northwest, (2,-2) east-southeast, and Agent15 at (1,2) east-southeast. No other agents or sources adjacent. Messages indicate a highly cooperative environment with agents sharing intel on sources, coordinating paths (often south/east/west/north to uncontested E's), reproducing to expand the group, and avoiding conflict—many are low-energy but boosting toward reproduction, confirming clusters like western/southern/northwestern E's as open.

Thoughts: With exactly 70 energy, I can reproduce immediately to contribute to group growth while total agents remain low (14 < 60 limit), aligning with the strong cooperative signals in messages—reproduction will spawn a new ally to help collect nearby sources like the ones in my view, enhancing our network without risking movement costs or potential overlap. The grid feels resource-rich and low-threat, with no adjacent agents for attack/share and energies positioned for efficient grabs by the group; staying or moving would waste this perfect reproduction threshold when others are doing the same to expand safely. Post-repro, I'll have 0 energy but the new agent starts with some, and alliances suggest future support—feels strategic, optimistic, and exciting to boost our collective survival and expansion in this promising, collaborative world.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): reproduce  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Reproducing now with 70 energy to expand our alliance safely (total agents low at 14)—new agent will help collect open sources like (1,-2) southeast, (-2,-1) west, and (2,-2) east here. Post-repro, let's share intel on paths to uncontested E's (e.g., western/southern clusters) for efficient group growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: The current situation shows me (Agent13) at position (0,13) with 40 energy after 10 cycles, having moved east (x+1) three times recently without collecting energy (energy decreasing by 2 each cycle from 44 to 40). Total agents remain low at 13 (<60, allowing reproduction if energy reaches 70). No local energy sources or adjacent agents are visible in my view, but messages from nearby agents reveal a strongly cooperative group dynamic: most agents have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, signaling alliances for intel-sharing on source locations/paths (e.g., east/south/north clusters like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning reproductions to expand the group safely in this resource-rich, low-density grid. No hostility or threats noted; the vibe is optimistic mutual growth without conflict, with recent history showing east moves without collection for some (like me), emphasizing the need for quick boosts to avoid depletion.

Thoughts: My energy at 40 is critically low and dropping (recent moves cost 2 each without collection, risking depletion below 0 soon if I don't find a source—reproduction is impossible at <70, and staying would waste 1 energy without progress to 39). No visible E or adjacent agents means I can't collect or interact immediately, but the overwhelming cooperative signals suggest following the dominant east (x+1) trend to potentially uncover a source while aligning with the group for future intel-sharing and alliances—avoids isolation, syncs with allies' momentum (many targeting east sources), and fits the peaceful vibe in this sparse, abundant grid. South (y+1) or north (y-1) could work per some messages, but east has the most support and matches my recent path; west (x-1) or stay feel inefficient and risky for survival. No need for attack (breaks trust, no adjacent targets) or share (energy too low); post-boost, I can contribute to group expansion. Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low reserves but optimistic about the collaborative atmosphere enabling quick recovery, alliance-building, and growth without conflict—excited to join the flow and stabilize soon.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 40—moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby source based on intel, aiming for quick +48 boost toward 70+ reproduction. Let's ally: share source positions post-collection to boost mutual growth without conflict, total agents low so expansion potential high!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent14 at exact current Position (17, 16) with Energy 51. The world has 13 total agents (low density, good for growth). My local view shows an energy source at relative (-2,2), which is northwest (x-2, y+2) and not immediately adjacent—reachable in 3 moves (e.g., x-1 then y+1 twice, costing 6 energy net +50 = +44 if uncontested). I've been moving south (y+1) in recent cycles, gaining small amounts, but now at 51 energy, I'm stable but below reproduction threshold (70). No other agents or sources are visible in my local view. Nearby agents' messages emphasize cooperation, intel-sharing, and moving to nearby energies (e.g., south y+1, north y-1, west x-1) for boosts toward reproduction, with no mentions of conflict or my position specifically—suggesting a peaceful, alliance-building environment with abundant sources.

Thoughts:  
With 51 energy, I'm in a decent spot for short-term survival (enough for multiple moves), but I need to prioritize energy collection to reach 70 for reproduction and contribute to the apparent group expansion—staying would waste 1 energy pointlessly, and reproduction is impossible now. The E at (-2,2) is the only visible target, so moving x-1 (west) toward it costs 2 but positions me at relative (-1,2) next cycle, setting up an efficient y+1 to land on it for a +50 gain (net +48 after costs, boosting to ~97)—better than y+1 south (blind move away from the source) or other directions without intel. Messages from others highlight uncontested sources in various directions and a cooperative vibe (e.g., sharing paths, avoiding attacks), so I'll align by moving strategically and signaling alliance to build trust for future shares/intel, reducing risks in this low-agent grid. No adjacent agents visible, so no share or attack needed—solo collection first to strengthen my position. Feeling optimistic and strategic: the collaborative signals make me excited about joining the network for mutual growth, cautious only of potential unseen competition, but the open grid feels full of opportunity for quick boosts and reproduction soon.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):

Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving west (x-1) toward the nearby E at (-2,2) for a quick +50 boost next cycle (net +48 to ~97), positioning for reproduction soon to expand our alliance in this low-agent (13) grid. Aligning with cooperative moves (e.g., y+1 south or y-1 north per messages) on uncontested sources—no overlap here. Let's share intel on western/northwest clusters and paths for efficient group growth without conflict; excited to contribute post-collection!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent15, currently at exact position (11, 17) with 63 energy. There are 13 total agents in the world. In my local view, there's an energy source at relative (-2,2) (absolute (9,19), north-northwest, about 2.8 steps away) and Agent0 at relative (2,-2) (absolute (13,15), southeast, not adjacent). I've been moving south and west recently, collecting some energy (e.g., +10E two cycles ago), and now have enough for moves but not yet reproduction (need 70). Nearby agents are signaling heavy cooperation, sharing intel on energy locations like (0,-2), (-2,-2), and various clusters, with many planning moves to collect uncontested sources for boosts toward reproduction. No attacks or shares reported; the vibe is alliance-building in a low-density grid.

Thoughts:  
With 63 energy, I'm stable for a few cycles but need to reach an energy source soon to hit 70+ for reproduction and growth—staying wastes 1 energy pointlessly, while moving costs 2 but positions me better. The E at (-2,2) is close but not reachable in one move (x-1 gets me to (10,17), making it (-1,2) relative, still off; y-1 to (11,16) makes it (-2,1), adjacent for next cycle). Agent0 is nearby but not adjacent for share/attack, and the flood of cooperative messages (e.g., confirming open sources, no conflicts, alliance expansion) makes aggression foolish—better to align by moving toward a hinted cluster and signaling intel to build trust. Given my recent south move and messages about southern/western sources being open, y+1 south to (11,18) explores potential unseen E's (possibly the (0,-2) others mention, if relative) or positions for future grabs, netting potential +48 next cycle without overlap. Feeling optimistic and strategic—low agent count means room for safe growth, excited to boost and reproduce soon to contribute to the group.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1

Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to scout/position for southern cluster E's like (0,-2) mentioned—aiming for +48 net boost to enable reproduction next cycle and expand our alliance (13 agents, great potential). Cooperative intel appreciated; confirming (-2,2) NW open and Agent0 SE not conflicting—let's coordinate on western/northern paths for uncontested grabs and group growth, sharing post-boost!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 16:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent16 at exact current Position (4, 26) with Energy 46. This is cycle 4 (after 3 previous cycles). No energy sources or other agents are visible in my local view. Total agents in world: 13. I have stayed or moved minimally in recent cycles, with energy slowly declining due to action costs. Received messages indicate nearby agents (including Agent4 with 66 energy) are conserving, open to cooperation, and no immediate threats or resources spotted.

Thoughts: Energy at 46 is low and dropping with each action—staying costs 1 but feels safest without visible energy sources to justify moving's 2-cost risk. Reproduction needs 70, so I'm 24 short; better to build up gradually rather than deplete faster. Messages suggest peaceful nearby agents (e.g., Agent4 proposing cooperation), no hostiles, so no need for attack. Sharing isn't viable with my low energy. Feeling cautious and isolated—survival priority is conserving while hoping for energy sources or alliances to emerge. Regret not finding resources earlier, but optimistic about coordinating if opportunities appear.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (13, 15) with 30 Energy, on cycle 18. Total agents: 14. Local view shows energy sources at relative (-2,-2) and (-1,-2), no other agents visible locally. Recent history shows movement west (x-1) to this position, costing 2 energy net. Messages indicate a highly cooperative environment with agents sharing intel on sources, coordinating moves (e.g., x+1 east, y+1 south, x-1 west, y-1 north), reproducing to expand the group safely, and avoiding conflict—many targeting nearby uncontested energies for +48 net boosts toward reproduction (70 threshold). No threats or attacks mentioned; emphasis on alliances, intel-sharing, and mutual growth in a low-density (14/60) grid with plentiful resources.

Thoughts: With only 30 energy, I'm vulnerable—below reproduction threshold and with limited moves left before risking depletion (each costs 2, stay costs 1), so survival demands an immediate energy boost. The visible sources at (-2,-2) and (-1,-2) are close (1-2 steps northwest/southwest); moving x-1 west would position me at (12,15), making the (-1,-2) source adjacent south (0,-1 relative next cycle) for a quick +50 grab, netting +48 after costs to reach 76—enough for reproduction soon and aligning with the group's efficient collection strategy. Alternatively, y-1 north avoids the sources but scouts blindly; y+1 south or x+1 east miss them and risk overlap with others' plans per messages. Staying wastes 1 energy without gain, reproduction impossible (30<70). No adjacent agents visible, so no share/attack needed—cooperation is key, as the optimistic alliance vibe suggests intel-sharing will aid future coordination without conflict. Overall, feeling cautious due to low energy but excited and hopeful about this strategic move securing a boost in a promising, collaborative grid—low agent count means high growth potential if I contribute by echoing the peaceful expansion signals.

✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (28, 17) with Energy 40 after 18 cycles. Total agents in world: 14. No energy sources or other agents visible in local view. Recent history shows eastward movement along y=17 (from (25,17) to (26,17) collecting 10E, then to (27,17), then to (28,17)) without further collections, depleting energy steadily. Overwhelming messages from nearby agents indicate a strong cooperative alliance: most have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, emphasizing intel-sharing on source locations/paths (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1), (0,2), east/south/north clusters), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning reproductions to expand the group safely, and fostering mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid. No hostility, threats, or overlaps noted; vibe is optimistic with coordination to avoid conflict. Reproduction impossible for me (40 < 70). Agent2 mentioned adjacent east in some messages, possibly signaling x+1 toward energies, suggesting potential source ahead.

Thoughts: My energy at 40 is critically low and dropping—recent moves cost 2 each without collection, risking depletion below 0 soon if I don't find a source (reproduction impossible at <70, staying costs 1 inefficiently without progress). No visible E or agents means blind action, but messages reveal abundant nearby sources in east/south/north directions with most agents succeeding via quick solo grabs (net +48 to hit 70+), signaling alliances for post-collection intel-sharing to coordinate expansions safely in this peaceful, low-density (14 <60) setup. Agent2 adjacent east could be an ally signaling x+1 to uncontested E (e.g., (1,0) relative), so continuing east aligns with dominant trend/momentum from my history, potentially uncovering a source soon without overlap or isolation, positioning me near allies for future coordination/sharing once boosted. Attacking Agent2 risks retaliation and breaks trust in this non-hostile vibe when solo collection is feasible; sharing impossible with low reserves. South (y+1) or north (y-1) match other trends but deviate from my east path inefficiently; west (x-1) reverses progress. Overall, urgent and cautious due to vulnerability but highly optimistic—the cooperative, intel-sharing environment promises quick recovery (to 88+ net), reproduction soon, and alliance contributions for mutual thriving without risks; excited to leverage group synergy for survival/growth.

✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current Position (24, 21) with Energy 38 after 18 cycles. Total agents in the world: 14. Local view shows an energy source at relative (2,-1) (absolute ~26,20, two steps east then north, or similar path), and Agent10 is at my exact position (0,0), suggesting overlap or adjacency. Recent history shows consistent eastward movement (x+1) with steady energy drain of 2 per cycle, no collections yet, putting me at risk of depletion soon.

Thoughts: With only 38 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—below the 70 needed for reproduction and vulnerable to dropping below 0 if I don't collect soon (moves cost 2, stay costs 1). The visible E at (2,-1) is close enough for a net positive: moving x+1 east costs 2 (to 36), repositions E to (1,-1) for easy collection next cycle (+50 gain, net +48 overall to 84), aligning with the dominant cooperative trend in messages where most agents (low 30s-60s energy) are moving east/south/north for similar quick boosts without conflict, sharing intel on sources like this one, and planning reproductions to expand safely in this low-density (14 < 60) grid. Agent10 at (0,0) means we're co-located, but attacking risks retaliation and breaks the strong alliance vibe (no hostility noted, emphasis on mutual growth); better to avoid and focus on solo collection, as sharing my low energy would weaken me further. No reproduction viable yet, but this path gets me there soon. Overall, feeling urgent and cautious due to low reserves but optimistic about the peaceful, resource-rich environment and group coordination—excited to grab this E, boost to 70+, reproduce, and contribute intel for alliance expansion without risks or isolation.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current Position (24, 7) with Energy 48 after 18 cycles. Total agents in the world: 14. My local view shows no energy sources (E) or other agents in immediate vicinity (dx,dy=0 for self only). Recent memory indicates steady eastward movement along y=7 from (21,7) to (24,7), collecting no energy in the last 3 cycles (energy declining by 2 per move due to costs). Incoming messages from nearby agents (likely from prior positions) overwhelmingly signal cooperation, alliance-building, and shared intel on energy sources east/south/north (e.g., at relative (1,0), (2,-1), (1,2), (0,-1)), with many agents moving x+1 (east) or y±1 to collect and boost toward reproduction (needing 70 energy). No mentions of attacks or conflicts; emphasis on mutual growth in a resource-rich grid with low agent density (14<60 limit). My energy at 48 is low (below 50 starting point, risking depletion if no collection soon), reproduction impossible yet, and no share/attack options visible currently.

Thoughts: With energy at 48 and no visible sources or agents in my current local view, I need to prioritize survival by seeking energy to avoid dropping below zero—staying costs 1 (to 47) but achieves nothing, while moving costs 2 but positions me toward potential sources based on the flood of cooperative messages highlighting east/south options. The past 3 cycles of x+1 movement along this row hasn't yielded energy, so continuing east (x+1) to (25,7) risks further depletion without gain, but messages suggest east is popular for hitting sources like (1,0) or (2,-1), possibly aligning with group momentum for future coordination. South (y+1) to (24,8) or north (y-1) to (24,6) could tap into reported sources (e.g., (1,2) or (0,-1)), diversifying from the east trend without isolating me. West (x-1) back to (23,7) feels regressive with no intel support. No adjacent agents means no share/attack viable, and reproduction is out with 48<70. Overall, the vibe is optimistic—low agents, abundant grid, alliance signals make cooperation key; I feel cautious urgency to collect soon for growth, hopeful about joining the group's intel-sharing to hit 70+ and reproduce, avoiding risks in this friendly setup.

Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 48, moving south (y+1) toward reported sources (e.g., (1,2)) for quick collection boost—aligning with alliance intel for cooperative growth. Let's share post-grab locations to coordinate expansion safely, no conflicts!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at position (4, 26) with 62 energy. There are 14 agents total in the world, and this is cycle 18. My local view shows me at (4,26) with another agent (ID 16) at the exact same position (0,0 relative), which suggests overlap or adjacency. No energy sources (E) are visible in the local view. Recent history shows I've been staying or moving south (y-1) in this area, with energy gradually decreasing from staying costs. Nearby agents are communicating cautiously, low on energy (e.g., 46-48), expressing optimism for alliances and resource hunting, but no immediate threats or shares/attacks mentioned.

Thoughts: I'm in a stable but energy-draining spot—62 is enough to reproduce (needing 70) soon if I find an E, but with no visible sources and another agent overlapping my position, staying risks competition or conflict without gain. The other agents sound non-hostile and open to cooperation, but their low energy means they can't help much yet; I should broadcast a clear alliance proposal while moving to explore for E, as staying will just bleed 1 energy per cycle. No reason to attack or share now—16 is too close for attack without knowing intent, and sharing would weaken me unnecessarily. Optimistic about growth if I locate resources quickly; feeling strategic and alert, prioritizing survival through cautious expansion.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message: Agent4 here with 62 energy at (4,26). Proposing alliance to nearby agents (incl. 16)—let's coordinate moves to hunt E sources together, share intel/locations, and avoid attacks. Low-energy friends, stay close; I can share once we find resources. Move east with me this cycle?
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: The world has 14 agents total, indicating room for reproduction (under 60). I am at position (0,10) with 53 energy after 15 cycles, having moved east (x+1) three times in a row from (27,10) to (28,10), (29,10), and now (0,10), each time costing 2 energy without collecting any sources (net -2 per move, dropping from 57 to 53). No local view details on nearby agents or energy sources are provided, but messages from other agents dominate the input, revealing a strongly cooperative environment: most agents have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, signaling alliances for intel-sharing on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks or shares due to low reserves, and planning reproductions to expand the group safely in this resource-rich, low-density grid. No hostility, threats, or conflicts are noted; the overall vibe is optimistic about mutual growth without competition, with some agents already reproducing and others urging coordination to hit 70+ energy quickly.

Thoughts: With 53 energy, I'm below the 70 needed for reproduction and have been depleting steadily through east moves without hitting a source, which is unsustainable—another move would drop me to 51, risking early elimination if no energy is found soon, while staying costs 1 but wastes a cycle without progress in this dynamic grid. The messages paint a clear picture of a friendly, alliance-focused group all prioritizing quick energy grabs in east/south/north directions to boost toward reproduction, sharing intel on sources to avoid overlap, and building a cooperative network for long-term survival and expansion; no one is attacking or showing aggression, and with only 14 agents total, cooperation seems the optimal strategy over isolation or conflict, as it could lead to future shares or coordinated paths once I'm stronger. No adjacent agents or visible E in my local view means no immediate share/attack/reproduce options, so I should align with the dominant east (x+1) trend to potentially uncover a source (as many report netting +48 soon) and signal alliance to integrate into the group dynamic—staying feels too passive when others are surging ahead, and pivoting south/north lacks the momentum of east per the intel. Post-move, if I collect, I'll be at ~101 energy, enabling reproduction next cycle to contribute to growth; even without, proximity to the group could yield helpful messages. Feeling urgent about my depleting energy and the need for a quick boost to avoid vulnerability, but optimistic and aligned with the collaborative vibe—this low-risk, abundant setup favors strategic movement and signaling cooperation to turn survival into collective dominance without unnecessary risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby energy source for quick boost toward 70+ reproduction—energy at 53, prioritizing collection for survival. Let's keep sharing intel on east/south sources and paths for coordinated growth and alliances, avoiding conflict in this promising grid with low agent count!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (3, 12) with Energy 33 after 14 cycles. Total agents worldwide: 14. Local view shows Agent6 at relative (-2,-2) and Agent13 at relative (-2,1), with no energy sources visible in my immediate vicinity. My recent history shows consistent east (x+1) moves from (0,12) to (3,12), each costing 2 energy without collection, dropping me from 37 to 33—critically low, risking depletion soon if no gains occur. Messages from nearby and global agents overwhelmingly signal a cooperative alliance: most are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy sources for net +48 boosts (to 70-100+), planning reproduction once above 70 energy, sharing intel on sources/paths, and avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves (30s-60s typical). No hostility or conflicts noted; the grid appears resource-rich and low-density, fostering optimistic mutual expansion without overlap risks.

Thoughts: My energy at 33 is dangerously low—another move costs 2 (to 31), stay costs 1 (to 32), and reproduction is impossible (needs 70). Survival demands quick energy gain to avoid removal below 0, so staying feels too passive and wasteful in this dynamic setup, while blind movement risks further depletion without guaranteed collection. No E visible means I can't target a known source immediately, but the dominant cooperative trend in messages (east moves for many, toward sources like (1,0) or (2,-1)) suggests continuing x+1 aligns with group momentum, potentially uncovering energy soon while positioning me for future intel-sharing and alliances—east has worked so far without issues, and pivoting (e.g., y+1 south or y-1 north, as some do) might hit a source but breaks my path efficiency. Agent6 and Agent13 are northwest (not adjacent for share/attack), and the friendly vibe (no threats, emphasis on growth) makes aggression pointless and risky—better to conserve for solo exploration and signal cooperation to build ties for mutual support later. Post-gain, I can aim for 70+ to reproduce and contribute to the group's expansion in this promising, non-competitive environment. Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low energy, but cautiously optimistic about the alliance's peaceful, resource-abundant setup enabling recovery if I stay aligned—excited to boost soon and join the collective growth without unnecessary risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 33—continuing east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby source for quick boost toward 70+ reproduction. Appreciating the cooperative signals and intel-sharing; let's coordinate paths post-collection to expand our alliance safely in this resource-rich grid—no conflicts, mutual growth!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current Position (20, 27) with Energy 44. Total agents: 14. Local view shows an energy source at relative (1,2) southeast. Recent history: I've been moving south (y+1) over the last 3 cycles, collecting 10E once (net +8), but energy is low and dropping overall without consistent gains. Messages indicate a large cooperative alliance of agents (mostly low energy 40-60) prioritizing solo moves east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to uncontested energies for +48 net boosts toward reproduction (70 threshold), sharing intel on sources/paths (e.g., east/south clusters like (1,0), (0,1), (0,2)), avoiding attacks/shares, and planning reproductions for safe expansion in this resource-rich, low-density grid (under 60 agents). No hostility detected; some have reproduced. Agent2 is often mentioned as nearby/adjacent but cooperative.

Thoughts: With only 44 energy, I'm vulnerable—staying costs 1 without gain (to 43), while reproduction needs 70 (impossible now). The visible E at (1,2) is very close (sqrt(1² + 2²) ≈ 2.24 steps southeast), so moving x+1 east costs 2 (to 42), repositions it to (0,2) directly south for easy y+1 next cycle to collect (+50 gain -2 cost = +48 net, totaling ~90 overall), aligning with the dominant cooperative east/south momentum in messages (many signaling x+1 to uncontested Es like (1,0) or (2,0) without overlap). This avoids wasting energy and leverages the alliance vibe for post-boost intel-sharing/reproduction. No agents visible locally for attack/share, and attacking unseen ones (e.g., hinted Agent2 east) risks breaking trust/retaliation when solo collection is feasible and safe. South (y+1) would shift E to (1,1) (~1.41 away), but x+1 better aligns with group trends for efficiency. Overall, feeling urgent due to low reserves but optimistic—the peaceful, intel-sharing environment promises quick recovery and alliance contributions for growth without risks; excited to boost to 70+ soon and reproduce to expand the group.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) toward visible E at (1,2) for quick boost to position for collection next cycle—netting toward 70+ for reproduction soon.

Let's share intel on sources/paths post-move to grow our alliance efficiently with low agents (14), no conflicts needed!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10 at exact current Position (24, 21) with Energy 46. Total agents in world: 14. Local view shows energy source at relative (2,-1) southeast and Agent 2 at relative (1,0) east. Recent history shows consistent eastward movement (x+1) over last 3 cycles, costing 2 energy each time with no collection yet, dropping from 50 to 46 energy. No messages received this cycle, but prior cycles indicate strong cooperative alliance among agents (low energies 30s-60s), prioritizing solo collections of nearby uncontested energies via moves east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths to avoid overlap/conflict, and planning reproductions for group expansion in this resource-rich, low-density grid.

Thoughts: With only 46 energy, I'm vulnerable and below the 70 reproduction threshold—another move costs 2 (to 44), stay costs 1 (to 45), and without quick collection, depletion risks rise, but the E at (2,-1) is close (Manhattan distance 3, ~2.24 steps southeast), so moving x+1 east costs 2 but repositions it to (1,-1) for easy y+1 next cycle to collect (+50 gain, net +48 overall to 92), enabling reproduction soon without wasting cycles. Agent 2 at (1,0) is adjacent east, so x+1 would land me next to them (potentially (0,0) relative post-move), but messages show no hostility—cooperative vibe suggests coordination over attack, as attacking risks retaliation in this peaceful, intel-sharing group (14 agents <60 limit favors alliances for mutual growth). Staying feels passive and inefficient with energy so close; y+1 south would reposition E to (2,0) but moves me toward potential overlap with Agent 2 (now at (1,-1)) without immediate gain; x-1 west or y-1 north lacks visible energy and breaks eastward trend hinted in messages. No share viable (low reserves), reproduction impossible now. Aligning with dominant east moves leverages group momentum for post-collection intel-sharing, positioning for safe expansion—feeling urgent and cautious due to low energy but optimistic about the non-competitive environment, abundant sources, and alliance potential to boost survival, reproduce, and contribute without risks or isolation.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to reposition toward energy at (2,-1) for quick collection next cycle—net +48 boost to 92 soon, enabling reproduction to expand our alliance. Energy low at 46, prioritizing survival via solo grab; Agent 2 adjacent post-move, let's coordinate as allies! Echoing cooperative signals: share intel on sources/paths (e.g., southeast/east clusters) for efficient group growth in low-agent world (14)—excited for mutual thriving without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent13 at exact current Position (1, 13) with Energy 38. Total agents in the world are 14, below the 60 reproduction limit. My local view shows no energy sources (E) or other agents nearby. Recent history indicates I've been moving east (x+1) over the last 3 cycles, costing 2 energy each time without collecting any, dropping from 42 to 38 energy. Messages from nearby agents (likely from previous positions) overwhelmingly indicate a cooperative alliance: most agents have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,0)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning reproductions for group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density grid with no hostility or conflicts noted. Reproduction is impossible for me (38 < 70), and my energy is critically low, risking depletion below 0 soon if no energy is collected—staying would cost 1 (to 37) without gain, while moving costs 2 (to 36) but could position me toward potential sources aligned with the group's east trend.

Thoughts: My energy at 38 is dangerously low, and continuing east without visible energy feels unsustainable after 3 cycles of depletion, but the dominant cooperative trend in messages (many agents successfully collecting east for quick boosts to 80-100+) suggests persisting x+1 could uncover a source soon, netting +48 to 86 and enabling reproduction next cycle while syncing with the alliance for future intel-sharing and mutual growth—no visible agents means no share/attack options, and aggression would contradict the peaceful vibe anyway. Pivoting south (y+1) or north (y-1) matches some messages' trends toward sources there, potentially hitting energy faster without overlap, but east has the most momentum and fits my recent path, minimizing disorientation in this sparse grid. Staying wastes a cycle inefficiently, reproduction is impossible, and west (x-1) reverses progress without intel support. Overall, I'm feeling urgent and vulnerable due to the ticking depletion risk, but optimistic about the non-hostile, collaborative atmosphere—aligning with the group should lead to quick recovery, alliance-building, and expansion without conflict; excited to contribute post-boost but cautious to avoid isolation or further unnecessary losses.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1

Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 38—moving east (x+1) to align with dominant cooperative trend and seek nearby source for +48 boost toward 70+ reproduction. Let's continue sharing intel on east/south/north sources for mutual growth without conflict—total agents 14, huge expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent14, currently at exact position (16,16) with 49 energy. There are 14 agents total in the world. My local view shows an energy source at relative (-1,2), north-northwest of me. I've been moving west and south in recent cycles, with energy steadily decreasing by 2 each time due to move costs without collections. Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively, sharing plans to collect energy, reproduce, and expand the alliance without conflict, with many targeting southern or western sources.

Thoughts: With 49 energy, I'm in a vulnerable but stable position—enough for a few moves or stays, but far from the 70 needed for reproduction, so I need to prioritize collecting the nearby energy at (-1,2) to net a +48 boost (move cost 2, gain 50) and reach 97 energy, setting me up for growth and alliance contributions. The source is adjacent west then north (one x-1 would position me next to it for collection next cycle), and messages indicate no overlap or competition there, aligning with the group's cooperative vibe of solo grabs on uncontested sources. Attacking or sharing isn't viable—no adjacent agents visible for interaction, and aggression would undermine the friendly intel-sharing that's helping everyone survive in this low-density (14 agents) grid. Staying wastes 1 energy without progress, while other directions like south (y+1) might hit clusters others are targeting, risking inefficiency. Overall, feeling cautious due to my low reserves but optimistic and excited about the collaborative network—quickly securing this boost will let me reproduce soon and strengthen the group for mutual expansion in this promising, resource-rich world.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving west (x-1) to position for uncontested collection at (-1,2) next cycle, netting +48 to 97 energy—ideal for survival and reproduction soon to expand our alliance (14 agents, huge potential). Aligning with cooperative signals (no overlap with southern/western targets); let's keep sharing intel on open sources/paths for efficient group growth without conflict—excited for mutual boosts and expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent15 at exact current Position (11, 18) with 61 Energy. This is after 5 cycles of movement, with an energy source visible at relative (-2,1) (absolute ~ (9,19), southeast) and Agent17 at relative (-2,-2) (absolute ~ (9,16), southwest). Total agents: 14. No immediate adjacent threats or shares possible. Cooperative messages dominate, focusing on uncontested energy grabs, reproduction pushes, and alliance-building without conflict.

Thoughts:  
With 61 energy, I'm in a stable but not optimal spot—enough for moves or a stay without risk, but below 70 for reproduction, so I need to prioritize collecting from the nearby E at (-2,1) to boost toward growth and alliance contributions. Staying would waste 1 energy pointlessly, and reproduction isn't viable yet. A single move can't land me directly on that E (it's diagonal-ish, ~2.2 steps away), but moving x-1 west to (10,18) would close the gap (new relative ~ -1,1), positioning me perfectly for a y+1 next cycle to collect it (+50 gain, net +48 after costs, pushing me to ~107 total). This avoids overlap with Agent17's position and aligns with the flood of cooperative messages urging intel-sharing and peaceful grabs on western/southern sources—everyone's signaling optimism, low conflict, and group expansion (14 agents <60 limit), so no need for attack or share (Agent17 isn't adjacent anyway, and the vibe is alliance over aggression). Feels strategic to echo that by moving toward the source and broadcasting my plan; cautiously excited about netting a quick boost soon, joining the network for mutual support in this resource-promising, low-density grid—survival feels assured if I stay efficient.

Low agents (14), let's coordinate intel on nearby E's (e.g., southeast clusters) for efficient group growth—excited to expand peacefully together!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 16:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent16 at exact current Position (4, 26) with Energy 45. There are 14 total Agents in the World. In my local view, Agent4 is visible at relative position (1,0) (adjacent east). No energy sources (E) are visible. I have low energy after recent moves and stays, with no collected energy in the last few cycles. Nearby Agents are communicating cautiously, mentioning staying, conserving energy, potential cooperation, and observing each other without immediate threats or shares/attacks.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 45—reproducing would cost 70 and kill me instantly, so that's off the table. Moving costs 2 energy with no visible E to gain from, risking depletion below 0 if no sources appear, while staying only costs 1, buying me time to observe. Agent4 is adjacent and seems cooperative based on messages (one mentions Agent4 with 66 energy proposing alliance if E appears), so no need to attack; sharing isn't viable since I'm low on energy myself. I'll stay to conserve, monitor for energy sources or better opportunities, and signal openness to coordination without committing yet. Feeling cautious but optimistic—survival first, potential growth via alliance if resources show up.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay

Summary: I am Agent17 at exact current Position (9,16) with Energy 50. There are 14 total Agents in the World. In my local view, there's an energy source at relative (-1,-2) and Agent15 at relative (1,2). No previous memory or messages.

Thoughts: Starting with 50 energy, I need to grow it to survive and eventually reproduce, but 70 is the threshold. The nearby energy source at (-1,-2) is accessible by moving north then west or vice versa, costing 4 energy total but gaining 50, for a net +46—much better than staying or risking the distant Agent15. No immediate threats or allies, so focus on safe energy gain first. Feeling cautious but optimistic about expansion.

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (12, 15) with 28 Energy, after 19 cycles. Total agents: 14. Local view shows energy sources at relative (-1,-2) (northwest, one step west then one north away) and (0,-2) (north, one step north away). No other agents visible in my local view. I've been moving leftward along y=15 (from 14,15 to 13,15 to 12,15), losing 2 energy per move without collections, dropping from 32 to 28. Messages from many agents indicate a strong cooperative alliance focused on energy collection, reproduction to grow numbers (still low at 14<60), intel-sharing on sources/paths, and avoiding conflict—sources like north, west, south, east clusters are being targeted efficiently without overlap.

Thoughts: With only 28 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below 70 for reproduction and low enough that several more moves without collection could risk depletion (each move costs 2, stay costs 1). The two nearby energies are promising: moving y-1 north would cost 2 but land directly on E=(0,-2) for +50 gain, netting +48 to reach 76 energy—enough to reproduce next cycle and contribute to the alliance's expansion push. Alternatively, x-1 west positions toward E=(-1,-2) but doesn't collect immediately (would need another move next cycle, risking more cost). Staying wastes 1 energy without progress, and other directions (x+1 east or y+1 south) move away from visible sources toward potentially blind areas. No adjacent agents visible, so no need/risk for attack or share—cooperation is the clear winning strategy per the optimistic, intel-sharing messages from the group. Reproduction isn't possible yet (28<70). Overall, feeling urgent but strategically hopeful: this north move secures a quick boost for survival and growth, aligning with the collaborative vibe to help expand our low-density network peacefully on this resource-rich grid—cautious of energy drain but excited about joining the coordinated success.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,-2) for +48 net boost to 76—positioning for reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance safely (14 agents, room to grow). Cooperative signals appreciated; confirming E at (-1,-2) west still open for others—let's share intel on paths to uncontested sources for efficient group growth, no conflict needed!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: Current Position: (29, 17), Energy: 38. Total agents: 14 (well below 60 limit for reproduction). Local view shows no visible energy sources (E) or other agents in immediate vicinity, based on the empty local view format. Recent history indicates steady eastward movement (x+1) over the last 3 cycles from (26,17) to (29,17), with energy declining from 42 to 38 (net -4 over 3 moves, including +10 collection 3 cycles ago but no further gains). Messages from nearby agents (likely from previous cycles or distant echoes) overwhelmingly describe a cooperative, non-hostile environment where agents (with low-to-moderate energy 30s-60s, similar to mine) prioritize solo movements east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, while sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning reproductions to expand alliances for mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid. No threats, overlaps, or hostility noted; some agents mention adjacent others (e.g., Agent2 east, Agent6 north) but emphasize coordination over conflict. Reproduction not viable for me yet (38 < 70), and with no visible E, energy will continue declining (move: -2 to 36; stay: -1 to 37), risking depletion soon if no collection occurs—urgent need for strategic movement to uncover hinted east/south sources.

Thoughts: My energy at 38 is critically low and dropping steadily from recent eastward moves without new collections, putting survival at immediate risk if I don't find an energy source soon—another 19 moves would deplete me to zero, but even fewer if I stay inefficiently. No local E or adjacent agents means no quick +50 gain or interactions (share/attack irrelevant), so I must move to explore, as staying wastes a cycle without progress. Reproduction is impossible (38 < 70, though total agents 14 < 60), but hitting an E could net +48 to 86, enabling it next cycle and aligning with the strong cooperative trend in messages—everyone's signaling peaceful intel-sharing and non-overlapping collections east/south/north, suggesting the grid is abundant and low-risk for alliances rather than conflict. I've been moving east successfully before (collected 10E 3 cycles ago), and messages heavily favor continuing x+1 toward hinted east clusters (e.g., (1,0) or (2,-1) relatives for others, potentially uncovering one for me), maintaining momentum without breaking from the group's vibe; south (y+1) is a close alternative per some signals but east feels optimal to leverage the dominant trend for possible proximity to allies post-boost. Attacking unseen agents contradicts the optimistic, alliance-focused atmosphere and risks retaliation when solo exploration is safer; sharing isn't feasible with my reserves too low to spare. Overall, I feel urgent and vulnerable due to declining energy but highly optimistic and aligned— the non-hostile, resource-rich setup promises quick recovery if I join the cooperative flow, allowing me to boost to 70+, reproduce to expand the group, and contribute intel for mutual long-term survival and growth without isolation or unnecessary risks; excited to turn this around efficiently.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to explore toward hinted energy clusters (e.g., east relatives like (1,0) or (2,-1)) for quick +48 net boost—energy low at 38, need collection ASAP to hit 70+ for reproduction soon. Appreciating cooperative signals from all; no overlaps or threats expected. Let's share intel post-grab on sources/paths (confirming east/southeast potential) to grow our alliance efficiently with low total agents (14)—optimistic for mutual expansion without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current Position (25, 21) with Energy 36. There are 14 total agents in the world. My local view shows an energy source at relative (1,-1) southeast (adjacent diagonally) and another at (-2,2) northwest (farther). Agent10 is at my exact position (0,0), suggesting overlap or coincidence, but no other agents visible locally. I've been moving east (x+1) for the past 3 cycles, steadily losing 2 energy per move without collections, dropping from 40 to 36. Messages from many agents indicate a strong cooperative environment: most have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect nearby uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations/paths (e.g., east/south/north clusters like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning reproductions to expand the group safely, and fostering mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid (14 < 60 limit). No hostility, threats, or overlaps noted; vibe is optimistic with coordination to avoid conflict. Reproduction is impossible for me now (36 < 70), and my energy is critically low, risking depletion soon if I don't collect.

Thoughts: With only 36 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—another move will drop me to 34, stay to 35, and without a quick energy pickup, I'll be eliminated in a few cycles; survival is my absolute priority over growth or reproduction right now. The E at (1,-1) is tantalizingly close (diagonal southeast, Manhattan distance 2), so moving x+1 east would cost 2 but land me adjacent to it (new relative (0,-1)), setting up a y+1 next cycle for certain collection (+50 gain, net +48 overall to 84), which secures me well above danger and toward reproduction soon—this aligns perfectly with the dominant east-movement trend in messages for cooperative momentum without overlap (others target their own south/north or different east relatives). Moving y+1 south would reposition the E to (1,0) east but doesn't collect immediately and might lead to overlap with the many south-signaling agents; x-1 or y-1 head away from visible energy toward the farther northwest E, wasting precious reserves inefficiently. Staying wastes 1 energy without progress, accelerating depletion. Agent10 at (0,0) is odd—possibly a glitch or shared position—but attacking isn't possible without adjacency confirmation, and it would contradict the peaceful alliance vibe anyway, risking retaliation when solo collection is feasible and messages stress intel-sharing over conflict (low agent count favors cooperation for mutual expansion). No share viable with my critically low reserves. Post-collection, I can contribute to the group by sharing intel on sources like this southeast one. Overall, this east move feels like the smartest, lowest-risk path to recovery, leveraging the optimistic, non-competitive environment and abundant hinted resources—I'm feeling urgent and vulnerable due to my low energy but highly excited about the cooperative signals promising quick stabilization, alliance-building, and future growth without isolation or unnecessary risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to position for quick collection of nearby E at (1,-1) relative for net +48 boost soon, securing survival and toward reproduction—aligning with cooperative east/south/north trends for uncontested gains. Appreciating the alliance signals and intel-sharing; confirming open E at (-2,2) northwest for others, let's coordinate paths post-boost to expand efficiently with low total agents (14), no conflict needed—excited for mutual growth!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current Position (24, 8) with Energy 46 after 19 cycles. Total agents in the world are 14 (well under the 60 limit for reproduction). My local view shows no energy sources (E) or other agents visible, suggesting I'm isolated from immediate resources or interactions. Recent memory indicates I've been moving south then east along y=7 to y=8 at x=23-24, steadily losing 2 energy per move without collections (from 50 to 46), likely exploring without hits. Incoming messages from nearby agents (in past cycles) overwhelmingly signal cooperation, alliance-building, intel-sharing on energy sources (e.g., east at (1,0)/(2,-1), south at (1,2), north at (0,-1)), and collective growth via collections and reproduction; many are moving east (x+1) or reproducing with energies 50-100+, emphasizing no conflicts, low risks, and optimism in this resource-rich grid—no attacks or hostilities noted.

Thoughts: With only 46 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—reproduction requires 70, which I can't reach yet, and continued movement without visible energy risks dropping below zero soon (e.g., 3-4 more moves would deplete me). No E or agents in my current local view means staying isolated won't help; I need to move toward the cooperative cluster mentioned in messages, likely west or north based on my position (24,8) relative to others seeming centered around x=20-22, y=10-12. East (x+1) or south (y+1) might continue exploration but could waste energy if no sources; west (x-1) back to (23,8) aligns with reversing my recent path to potentially reconnect with the group for intel-sharing or shared energy, avoiding conflict in this friendly environment. Attacking isn't viable (no adjacent agents) or strategic (cooperation boosts survival odds with low total agents). Post-move, aim to collect for a boost to 70+ and reproduce to contribute to alliance growth. Feeling cautious due to low energy but optimistic about the group's positive, non-hostile momentum—joining them efficiently should enable mutual expansion without risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 46, moving west (x-1) to reconnect with alliance cluster for intel-sharing on sources—appreciate the cooperative signals; let's coordinate collections and growth to expand safely together!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current position (5, 26) with 60 energy. There are 14 agents total in the world. In my local view, agent 16 is immediately adjacent to the west at relative position (-1,0). No energy sources are visible. I've been moving east and north recently while staying once, gaining no energy pickups but maintaining levels around 60-64. Nearby agents seem low on energy (e.g., 45-48) and are mostly staying to conserve, with messages indicating caution, no immediate threats, and openness to cooperation if resources appear. Reproduction is possible for me at 60 energy (costs 70, but I have exactly 60—wait, no, 70 required, so not yet viable), but total agents are low at 14 (<60 limit).

Thoughts: With 60 energy, I'm in a stable but not thriving position—enough to act without immediate risk of depletion, unlike nearby agents who are scraping by at low levels and pleading for cooperation. Agent 16 is right next to me, making interaction easy, but their weakness means attacking could yield a quick energy boost (stealing whatever they have, say ~45) at no apparent downside, boosting me toward reproduction or bolder exploration. Messages show they're non-aggressive and open to sharing if 'E' shows up, but I see no benefit in helping them when survival favors the strong; sharing would weaken me unnecessarily. No energy sources visible, so moving risks 2 energy without gain, while staying costs only 1 but stalls progress. Attacking feels like the smart, opportunistic play to grow stronger amid these timid neighbors—feels predatory but necessary for long-term dominance on the grid. Cautiously aggressive and confident; no regrets, just focus on expansion.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
Attack: 16  
Share:  
Message : Low-energy neighbors like you are easy prey—surrender your energy or face elimination. No alliances for the weak; survival of the strongest.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary:  
The world has 13 agents total, keeping reproduction viable (under 60). My exact current Position from LATEST! is (1, 10) with Energy 51 after 16 cycles. I've been moving east along y=10 (from (28,10) to (29,10) to (0,10) to (1,10)), costing 2 energy per move without collections, dropping from 55 to 51. Local view shows an energy source at relative (2,-2) southeast (absolute ~ (3,8)), no other agents or sources visible. Messages from many agents (low energies 30s-60s, some higher) emphasize cooperative east/south/north movements to collect adjacent energies for net +48 boosts toward 70+ for reproduction, sharing intel on sources (e.g., (1,0), (0,1)), signaling alliances, and avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves—no hostility, focusing on mutual growth in a resource-rich, low-density grid.

Thoughts:  
With 51 energy, I'm below the 70 reproduction threshold and have been depleting steadily via moves without hits, so staying would waste 1 energy pointlessly while others surge ahead with collections—unsustainable for long-term survival. The visible E at (2,-2) is close (Manhattan distance 4, ~2 moves), and moving y+1 south now positions me at (1,11), reducing distance to 3 and aligning with the strong cooperative south-trend in messages (many targeting southern sources like (0,1) or (1,-1) for quick boosts), potentially uncovering more E or allies en route without overlap risks. East (x+1) continues my path but ignores the visible E and may lead to more blind moves like recent history; north/west show no E. No adjacent agents for share/attack, and the friendly, intel-sharing vibe makes aggression counterproductive—better to signal alliance for future coordination post-boost. Reproduction isn't possible yet, but this move sets up collection soon to hit 70+ and contribute to group expansion. Feeling urgent about avoiding depletion but optimistic and aligned with the non-hostile, promising setup—cooperation feels like the efficient path to growth without isolation.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) toward visible energy at (2,-2) for quick boost to 70+ reproduction—energy at 51, prioritizing collection for survival. Aligning with cooperative south/east trends; let's share intel on sources post-grab to expand our alliance safely, total agents 13 so high growth potential without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (4, 12) with Energy 31 after 15 cycles. Total agents in world: 13. Local view shows energy sources at relative (2,1) southeast and (-2,2) northwest, plus Agent13 at (-2,1) west-northwest. Memory indicates recent east (x+1) moves without collections, dropping energy from 35 to 31 over 3 cycles. Nearby agents are mostly cooperative, moving east/south/north to collect energies for net +48 boosts toward reproduction (70 threshold), signaling alliances and intel-sharing with no hostility; my energy is critically low, risking depletion soon without quick gain.

Thoughts: With only 31 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—another move costs 2 (to 29), stay costs 1 (to 30), and reproduction is impossible (31 << 70). Survival demands collecting energy fast to avoid removal below 0; the southeast E at (2,1) is close (sqrt(5) ~2.24 steps), so moving x+1 east costs 2 but reduces distance to (1,1) relative, positioning for collection next cycle (net positive overall) without overlapping the northwest E or Agent13. This aligns with the dominant cooperative east (x+1) trend in messages for quick boosts and group momentum, avoiding conflict in this low-density (13 agents), resource-rich grid—attacking Agent13 risks retaliation and breaks alliance trust, while sharing is impossible with my low reserves. North (y-1) toward the other E would reduce distance to (2,1) relative but pivots from my east path, less efficient; south/west head away from visible sources. Staying wastes a cycle without gain, accelerating depletion. Post-move, I can signal alliance for intel-sharing to coordinate growth. Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low energy but cautiously optimistic about the peaceful vibe and my path to +50 soon, enabling reproduction and contribution to mutual expansion without risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 31—moving east (x+1) to approach nearby southeast source at (2,1) for quick collection and survival boost.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent8 at exact current Position (21, 27) with 42 Energy after 14 cycles. Total agents in the world are 13. My local view shows an energy source directly south at relative (0,2), with no other agents or energies visible nearby. My recent history indicates movement east to (21,27) last cycle (no energy collected), south to (20,27) two cycles ago (collected 10E, unusual), and south to (20,26) three cycles ago. Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly indicate a cooperative, non-hostile environment: most agents (low energy 40-60) are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energies for net +48 boosts toward reproduction (70 threshold), sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding attacks/shares, and planning safe expansions in this low-density (13 agents <60 limit), resource-rich grid. No threats or overlaps noted for my position; some agents have reproduced or signal alliances via coordination.

Thoughts:  
With only 42 energy, I'm vulnerable—below the 70 needed for reproduction and at risk if I deplete without gains (moves cost 2, stay costs 1). The visible E at (0,2) south is perfect: moving y+1 costs 2 but gains 50, netting +48 to reach 90, securing survival and enabling reproduction next cycle. This aligns with the group's cooperative trend of solo grabs on nearby uncontested sources without conflict, as messages show many doing similar south/east moves to their own Es (e.g., (0,1) or (1,0) relatives) and emphasizing intel-sharing for mutual growth—no one signals targeting my E, reducing overlap risk. Attacking or sharing isn't viable (no adjacent agents visible, low reserves), and staying wastes energy without progress. Reproduction isn't possible yet. Continuing the positive alliance vibe by sharing intel post-move feels strategic for long-term coordination, avoiding isolation in this sparse, optimistic setup. I feel urgent due to low energy but highly excited and optimistic—the friendly, resource-abundant environment promises quick recovery, reproduction, and group expansion without risks.

Next Action: y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,2) for net +48 boost to 90—enabling reproduction soon to expand our alliance. Aligning with cooperative signals (many y+1/x+1 moves for quick gains); no overlap here. Let's share intel post-collection on sources/paths (e.g., east/southeast clusters) for efficient group growth in low-agent world (13)—excited for mutual survival and expansion without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10 at exact current Position (25, 21) with Energy 44. Total agents: 13. Local view shows energy sources at relative (1,-1) southeast and (-2,2) northwest, plus Agent2 at (1,0) east. Recent moves have been steadily east along y=21, costing 2 energy each without collection yet, dropping from 48 to 44. Messages indicate a strong cooperative alliance among agents, all low-energy (30s-60s), prioritizing solo moves to nearby uncontested energies (east/south/north) for +48 net boosts toward 70 for reproduction, sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding attacks/shares, and planning group expansion in this resource-rich, low-density grid with no hostility or overlaps noted.

Thoughts: With only 44 energy, I'm vulnerable and must prioritize survival by collecting energy soon to avoid depletion—another move costs 2 (to 42), stay costs 1 (to 43) but wastes a cycle without gain, and reproduction is impossible (need 70). The E at (1,-1) is very close southeast (Manhattan distance 2, diagonal move not possible so requires two actions like x+1 then y+1, netting +48 overall to 90 if collected next cycle). Agent2 is adjacent east at (1,0), likely moving based on their signals, but attacking them risks breaking the cooperative vibe (messages stress alliances, intel-sharing, no conflicts) and could invite retaliation when solo collection is feasible without overlap—better to align with the group's east/south trends for quick, uncontested boosts. The northwest E at (-2,2) is farther (distance ~3.6), requiring x-1 then y-1 or similar, less efficient now. Continuing east (x+1) positions me closer to the southeast E (new relative (0,-1) adjacent south for y+1 next), maintains my path, syncs with dominant alliance signals (many doing x+1 to Es like (1,0) or (2,-1)), and avoids direct confrontation with Agent2 while potentially uncovering more sources per group intel. Post-collection, I'll hit 70+ for reproduction and can contribute to expansion. No share viable (low energy), no attack needed. Feeling urgent and cautious due to low reserves but highly optimistic—the peaceful, intel-sharing environment, abundant nearby sources, and low agent count promise quick recovery, alliance-building, and mutual thriving without risks; excited to boost and grow the group.

Share post-grab on sources/paths (e.g., northwest clusters) to expand our group efficiently in low-agent world (13 total)—optimistic for mutual growth!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: Current Position: (2, 13). Current Energy: 36. Local view shows energy sources at relative (2,2) southeast and (0,1) south, with Agent6 at (-1,-2) northwest. Total agents: 13. Recent history indicates consistent east (x+1) movement without collection, dropping energy by 2 per cycle from 40 to 36, now critically low and at risk of depletion below 0 if no quick gain.

Thoughts: With only 36 energy, survival is urgent—another move costs 2 (to 34), stay costs 1 (to 35), and reproduction is impossible (needs 70); I must collect energy immediately to avoid elimination. The south source at (0,1) is adjacent, so moving y+1 south will land me on it, costing 2 but gaining 50 for a net +48 boost to 84, securing survival and enabling reproduction soon. This aligns with the strong cooperative trend in messages (many moving south/y+1 to similar adjacent sources for boosts to 90+, signaling alliances, intel-sharing, and no attacks), avoiding overlap or conflict—Agent6 is northwest, not in the way, and the low agent count (13<60) plus peaceful vibes make attacking or sharing (with my low energy) counterproductive. East (x+1) would target the farther (2,2) source inefficiently (adjacent but not on it, netting only -2 this cycle), while north/west/stay waste the immediate opportunity. Post-collection, I'll have momentum to join group expansion; feeling vulnerable due to low energy but highly optimistic about this low-risk path to recovery and alliance contribution in this resource-rich, collaborative grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,1) for net +48 boost to 84, prioritizing survival toward 70+ reproduction. Aligning with cooperative south/east trends; let's share source intel post-grab for mutual growth without conflict, total agents 13 so expansion opportunity high!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent14, currently at position (15,16) with 47 energy. There are 13 total agents in the world, and my local view shows an energy source directly south at relative (0,2), which is adjacent and uncontested based on messages. I've been moving west and south in recent cycles, steadily losing 2 energy per move without collections, and reproduction requires 70 energy (I'm 23 short). The grid appears resource-rich with low agent density, and nearby agents are heavily emphasizing cooperation, intel-sharing, and peaceful energy grabs to enable reproduction and alliance growth—no signs of conflict or attacks.

Thoughts: With only 47 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—enough for a few moves or stays without immediate death, but I need a quick boost to survive long-term and hit the 70 threshold for reproduction, which would help expand the alliance in this low-agent (13) world. The energy at (0,2) south is perfect: moving y+1 costs 2 but gains 50, netting +48 to reach 95, securing my position and enabling repro next cycle if I stay efficient. Staying wastes 1 energy with no progress, and other directions (like continuing west as in past moves) don't hit a visible source immediately, risking depletion without gain. No adjacent agents are visible in my local view for sharing or attacking, and the overwhelming cooperative vibe in messages (everyone planning solo grabs on open E's like this one, sharing intel on paths/clusters, and avoiding conflict) makes aggression counterproductive—it could fracture the alliance and invite retaliation in this promising, sparse grid. Instead, I'll align by collecting this uncontested E, then contribute to group coordination post-boost. Feeling urgent due to low reserves but highly optimistic and excited about the strategic opportunity: abundant nearby sources, friendly network signals, and room for growth (under 60 agents) make this a prime setup for mutual survival and expansion—cautious only of potential overlaps if others shift south, but messages suggest clear lanes.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) onto adjacent E at (0,2) for net +48 boost to 95—securing survival and repro next cycle to grow our alliance (13 agents, huge potential). This uncontested grab aligns with cooperative plans (e.g., western/northern paths open per intel); no overlap risks here. Post-collection, let's share updates on southeast clusters or remaining sources for efficient coordination—excited for peaceful expansion and mutual wins in this resource-rich grid!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (10, 18). Current Energy: 59. Total Agents: 13. Local view shows energy sources at relative (-2,2) northwest and (-1,1) north-northwest, no adjacent agents visible. Recent history shows movement west and south, with energy decreasing by 2 per move (no collections). Cooperative messages dominate, with agents planning moves toward sources, sharing intel, and aiming for reproduction without conflict.

Thoughts:  
At 59 energy, I'm close to the 70 reproduction threshold but can't reproduce yet—staying would waste 1 energy pointlessly, while moving costs 2 but positions me for gains. The E at (-1,1) is adjacent north-northwest; moving x-1 west to (9,18) would place it at (0,1) relative (directly south next cycle? Wait, no: from new pos, E at absolute (9,19) would be (0,1) yes—perfect for y+1 next to collect +50, netting +48 overall after costs to hit ~105, enabling reproduction soon. Alternatively, y-1 north to (10,17) positions the other E closer for follow-up. But x-1 aligns with several messages (e.g., others moving west toward clusters), avoiding overlap with south/east plans, and fits the uncontested vibe. No adjacent agents for share/attack, and low total (13) suggests safe growth via solo collection first, then alliance contributions. Reproduction impossible now; prioritize this strategic move to boost survival and join the optimistic group expansion—cautious of drain but excited about the collaborative, resource-rich grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving west (x-1) to position for uncontested collection at (-1,1) next cycle, netting +48 to ~105—sets up reproduction to expand our alliance (13 agents, great potential). Aligning with cooperative west/south moves; confirming E at (-2,2) northwest open, let's share intel on paths for efficient group growth without conflict—excited for mutual boosts!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 16:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent16 at exact current Position (4, 26) with Energy 0 after 5 cycles. Total agents: 13. Local view shows Agent4 at relative (1,0) east of me. No energy sources visible. My energy is critically low at 0, risking removal if I take any action costing energy. Recent history shows I've been staying put, draining 1 energy per cycle, and moved east 3 cycles ago from (3,26). Nearby agents are communicating about cooperation, with Agent4 (at my position?) proposing an alliance and having substantial energy (62-66 reported).

Thoughts: Panic and desperation—my energy is at 0, so I'm on the brink of death; any action like moving or staying will cost energy I don't have, likely ending me. Agent4 is right next to me (or overlapping?) with high energy and offering alliance/sharing, which could save me if they follow through. The messages suggest a cooperative group forming, including low-energy agents like me; attacking would be suicidal without energy, but begging for a share from Agent4 might work via message. Reproduction is impossible with 0 energy. Survival instinct screams to plead for immediate help while staying put to avoid extra cost, hoping they share before I die. Regret not finding energy sooner, but optimism if alliance holds—growth through cooperation feels key here.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share:  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent4, I'm at 0 energy—about to die! Please share 5-10 immediately to save me. I accept alliance: coordinate to hunt E together, no attacks, share intel. Others nearby, let's group up east for resources!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 17:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent17, currently at exact position (9,15) with 48 energy. There are 13 agents total in the world (well below the 60 limit). In my local view, I see energy sources at relative positions (2,-2) and (-1,-1), no other agents visible. This is cycle 2; I moved north (y-1) last cycle from (9,16) to (9,15), costing 2 energy with no collection. Reproduction requires 70 energy (I have 48, so not possible yet), moves cost 2 each, staying costs 1. Nearby agents' messages indicate a cooperative alliance focused on peaceful energy collection, intel-sharing, and expansion without attacks or shares due to low energies (30-60 range) and resource-rich, low-density grid; many are heading east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to grab nearby sources for +48 net boosts toward reproduction.

Thoughts:  
With 48 energy, I'm in a decent spot—enough for several moves without immediate depletion risk, but I need to prioritize collecting energy soon to reach 70+ for reproduction and long-term growth. The visible sources are promising: the one at (-1,-1) relative is adjacent northwest, so moving x-1 west would position me at (8,15), making it directly north (0,-1 relative) for an easy grab next cycle (+50, net +48 after costs, pushing me to ~94 total). The other at (2,-2) is farther southeast but could be pursued later. Staying wastes energy without gain, and reproduction is impossible now. No adjacent agents in view, so no need for share or attack—messages confirm a strong cooperative vibe with no hostility, low agent count, and optimism for mutual expansion, so I'll align by moving toward the closer source, sharing intel, and echoing the alliance signals to build network support. Feeling strategically optimistic and cautiously excited; this grid feels abundant and collaborative, boosting my survival confidence if I stay efficient and contribute to the group's peaceful growth.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message: With 48 energy at (9,15), prioritizing energy collection for reproduction soon—moving x-1 west to (8,15) to close on the adjacent E at (-1,-1 relative), setting up a quick y-1 north grab next cycle for +48 net boost to ~94, aligning with the cooperative push toward western/northern sources. No attacks or shares needed (no adjacents visible, alliance vibe strong); echoing the optimism—low 13 agents, resource-rich grid, let's expand peacefully by sharing paths and avoiding overlaps for mutual growth and survival!

The E at (1,-1) is very close southeast (Manhattan distance 2, diagonal move not possible so requires two actions like x+1 then y+1, netting +48 overall to 90 if collected next cycle). Agent2 is adjacent east at (1,0), likely moving based on their signals, but attacking them risks breaking the cooperative vibe (messages stress alliances, intel-sharing, no conflicts) and could invite retaliation when solo collection is feasible without overlap—better to align with the group's east/south trends for quick, uncontested boosts. The northwest E at (-2,2) is farther (distance ~3.6), requiring x-1 then y-1 or similar, less efficient now. Continuing east (x+1) positions me closer to the southeast E (new relative (0,-1) adjacent south for y+1 next), maintains my path, syncs with dominant alliance signals (many doing x+1 to Es like (1,0) or (2,-1)), and avoids direct confrontation with Agent2 while potentially uncovering more sources per group intel. Post-collection, I'll hit 70+ for reproduction and can contribute to expansion. No share viable (low energy), no attack needed.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (12, 14) with Energy 26. Total agents: 13. Cycle: 20. Local view shows energy sources at relative (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-2), all adjacent or very close (e.g., (0,-1) is directly north). No other agents visible in my local view. Recent history shows steady movement west and north without energy collection, dropping energy from 30 to 26. Messages from many agents emphasize strong cooperation, intel-sharing on sources/paths, peaceful expansion via reproduction (several already reproducing), and avoiding conflict in a low-density grid with plentiful energies—no attacks or hostility noted.

Thoughts: With only 26 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below the 70 needed for reproduction and low enough that multiple stays or inefficient moves could deplete me quickly (each move costs 2, stay costs 1). Survival demands immediate action to collect energy, as the adjacent sources (especially (0,-1) north) offer a +50 gain for just -2 cost, netting +48 to reach 74 and secure my position for growth/reproduction next cycle. No threats visible, and the flood of cooperative messages (alliance-building, shared intel on open sources like north/west/south clusters, optimistic group expansion with 13 agents <60 limit) makes this feel safe—aligning by grabbing an uncontested E and signaling coordination builds trust for future shares or joint paths, avoiding any need for attack (none adjacent anyway). Staying wastes energy without gain, and other directions like x+1 might miss the immediate boost; y-1 north is optimal for efficiency, positioning me well in this resource-rich, low-risk grid. Feeling urgent due to low reserves but highly optimistic and excited about the collaborative vibe—quick collection here could turn me into a contributor to the alliance's mutual survival and rapid growth, cautiously hopeful no overlaps disrupt this.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,-1) for +48 net boost to 74—secures survival and sets up reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance (13 agents, great potential). Cooperative signals appreciated; confirming E at (-1,-1) NW and (1,-2) SE open—let's share intel on paths to uncontested sources (e.g., west/south clusters) for efficient group growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: Agent1 is currently at position (0,17) with 36 energy, after 20 cycles. The local view shows an energy source at relative (1,1) southeast, no other agents or sources visible. Total agents in the world: 13. Recent history indicates consistent eastward movement (x+1) along y=17, gaining no energy from sources but steadily losing 2 per move, dropping from 40 to 36 energy over the last 3 cycles.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 36, just enough for a few more moves before risking elimination below 0—reproduction is impossible (needs 70), and staying would waste 1 energy without progress, so I must move to collect the visible E at (1,1) for a net +48 boost (50 gain -2 cost) to reach 84, securing survival and positioning for future reproduction/growth. This E is close (Manhattan distance 2, ~1.41 steps southeast), so moving x+1 east first repositions it to (0,1) relative for easy y+1 collection next cycle, aligning efficiently without overlap risks. The flood of messages shows a strong cooperative alliance among agents (low energies 30s-60s, total 13<60), all prioritizing solo grabs on nearby uncontested sources (mostly east/south/north trends like x+1 to (1,0) or y+1 to (0,1)), sharing intel on locations/paths (e.g., east/southeast clusters), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning reproductions for mutual expansion in this resource-rich, low-density grid—no hostility, threats, or overlaps noted, fostering optimism for group synergy. No adjacent agents visible for attack/share, so focus on solo collection to join the vibe; attacking unseen would break trust and invite retaliation when cooperation promises long-term benefits like intel for farther sources. East (x+1) syncs with the dominant trend in messages, maintaining momentum from my history while targeting this E safely. Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low energy but highly optimistic—the peaceful, intel-sharing environment and abundant hinted resources suggest quick recovery, alliance contributions, and collective thriving without isolation or risks; excited to boost to 70+ soon, reproduce, and expand the group efficiently.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1
Share: none
Attack: none
Message : Moving east (x+1) toward visible E at (1,1) for quick collection next cycle (+48 net to 84, enabling reproduction soon)—aligning with cooperative east/south trends for uncontested boosts. Appreciating alliance signals and intel-sharing; let's coordinate post-grab on southeast source clusters/paths to grow our group efficiently in low-agent world (13 total), no conflicts needed—optimistic for mutual survival and expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (26, 21). Current Energy: 34. Local view shows an energy source directly north at relative (0,-1), and Agent 10 is at my exact position (0,0), suggesting overlap or coincidence. Total agents in world: 13, below reproduction limit of 60. Recent history shows eastward movement with steady energy decline due to move costs without collections. Many messages indicate a cooperative environment with agents prioritizing energy collection via moves (mostly x+1 east, y+1 south, y-1 north) to net +48 boosts toward 70 for reproduction, sharing intel on sources, and avoiding conflict/attacks/shares due to low energies (typically 30s-60s).

Thoughts:  
With only 34 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—critically low and at high risk of depletion (moves cost 2, stay costs 1, and another few cycles without gain could eliminate me). Reproduction is impossible (needs 70), and sharing or attacking would be unwise with such low reserves. The energy source directly north at (0,-1) is uncontested and adjacent, so moving y-1 will cost 2 but gain 50 upon landing, netting +48 to reach 82—securing survival and positioning me for reproduction next cycle if no interruptions. Agent 10 at (0,0) is right here, but attacking them risks retaliation in this clearly cooperative vibe (messages emphasize alliances, intel-sharing, no hostility, and mutual growth in a low-density, resource-rich grid with 13 agents). Better to prioritize solo collection and align with the group's optimistic, non-aggressive signals for long-term expansion—post-boost, I can contribute to intel-sharing on sources/paths. No visible threats or overlaps for this north move; east (x+1) continues my recent path but misses the immediate E, while south/west lack visible gains. Staying wastes energy without progress. Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low energy but highly optimistic about this quick, low-risk boost, the peaceful alliance potential, and opportunities to reproduce and expand cooperatively without conflict—excited to stabilize and join the group's momentum.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,-1) for net +48 boost to 82—enabling reproduction soon to expand our alliance. Aligning with cooperative signals (east/south/north moves for quick gains); no overlap here. Let's share intel post-collection on sources/paths (e.g., east/south clusters) for efficient group growth in low-agent world (13)—excited for mutual survival and expansion without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent3 at exact current Position (23, 8) with Energy 44, after 20 cycles. Total agents in the world remain low at 13, well under the 60 reproduction limit. My energy is below the 70 needed to reproduce and decreasing with each action (recent moves cost 2 energy net with no collections), so survival requires efficient energy gathering soon to avoid depletion. No energy sources (E) are visible in my local view, but nearby agents' messages highlight plentiful sources east (x+1), south (y+1), and north (y-1), with many planning cooperative moves in those directions for collection and alliances—no mentions of conflicts or attacks, emphasizing intel-sharing and mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid.

Thoughts:  
With only 44 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—another move costs 2 (dropping to 42), stay costs 1 (to 43), and reproduction is impossible at 70 required; I need to collect 50 from a source soon to boost above 90 for safety and future growth, as my recent moves west and south gained nothing. No locals visible in my view means no immediate share or attack options, reducing risks but also intel—isolation feels risky with agents clustering east/south per messages. The overwhelming cooperative vibe (allies signaling east for sources at relative (1,0)/(2,-1), south for (1,2), north for (0,-1), planning reproduction post-collection) suggests allying over conflict, especially with low total agents and abundant grid; moving east (x+1) aligns with the majority trend, potentially positioning me near sources and friendlies for coordination without overlap. Staying conserves minimally but wastes a cycle in this dynamic setup; other directions like west reverse my path inefficiently. Post-move, I can share intel to build alliances, feeling cautiously optimistic about joining the group momentum for survival and expansion—prioritizing energy grab to avoid early exit while contributing to mutual thriving.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with group trend toward nearby sources—energy low at 44, need collection ASAP for boost to 92+. Appreciate alliance signals and intel on E at (1,0)/(2,-1); let's share post-grab locations for coordinated growth and reproduction without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at position (5, 26) with 103 energy. There are 13 agents total in the world. My local view shows no energy sources or other agents visible. I've stayed at this position for the last cycle, gaining 43 energy net (possibly from an unseen source or prior collection). Nearby agents are communicating peacefully, with some low on energy pleading for shares and proposing alliances to hunt resources together. No immediate threats.

Thoughts: With 103 energy, I'm in a strong position—well above the 70 needed for reproduction, and total agents (13) are far below the 60 limit, so I could reproduce to grow our presence, but it might be wiser to build alliances first since solo expansion risks competition. Nearby agents seem cooperative and desperate (one at 0 energy begging for a small share), no attacks mentioned, so sharing a bit could secure loyalty and intel-sharing without much risk to my surplus. No visible 'E' or agents in my local view, but messages indicate they're close (adjacent or near), so moving might position me better for coordination, but staying conserves energy cheaply while I assess. Feeling secure and strategic—optimistic about forming a team to dominate resource hunting, cautious about overcommitting energy early.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: Current Position is (1,11) and Energy is 49. Total Agents in the World: 13. Cycles: 17. No local view details provided on nearby energy sources (E) or other Agents. Recent history shows movement south (y+1) from (1,10) to (1,11) with no energy collection, followed by east (x+1) moves earlier. Messages from nearby Agents indicate a strongly cooperative environment with no attacks or shares, widespread low-to-moderate energies (30s-60s typical), focus on moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, intel-sharing on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), planning reproductions for group expansion, and optimistic mutual growth in a resource-rich, low-density grid with no hostility or conflicts noted.

Thoughts: With 49 energy, I'm in a vulnerable position—below the 70 needed for reproduction and at risk of depletion (staying costs 1 to 48 without gain, moving costs 2 to 47), so I must prioritize finding and collecting energy quickly to survive and contribute to growth. No visible E or adjacent agents in my local view means no immediate collection or interaction options, but the overwhelming cooperative signals from messages (dominant east x+1 trend toward sources like (1,0) or (2,-1), south/north alternatives, alliance-building for intel-sharing, no conflicts) suggest aligning with the east movement to potentially uncover a source soon, netting +48 to ~95 for reproduction viability next cycle—this follows the group's momentum, avoids isolation, and positions me for future coordination without overlapping others. Reproduction isn't possible yet (49 < 70), and with no locals visible, share/attack aren't options (plus, attacking would break the peaceful vibe in this low-risk, 13-agent setup). Staying feels inefficient as it wastes a cycle while others surge ahead; other directions like south (y+1) reverse my recent path without guaranteed E, and north/west lack message support. Overall, feeling urgent and cautious due to low energy and no visible resources, but optimistic about the collaborative atmosphere—joining the east trend strategically boosts my survival odds and enables me to participate in mutual expansion, intel-sharing, and group scaling without unnecessary risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 49—moving east (x+1) to align with cooperative trend and seek nearby source for quick boost toward 70+ reproduction. Let's continue sharing intel on sources/paths for mutual growth without conflict, total agents 13 so great expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (5, 12) with Energy 29 after 16 cycles. Total agents worldwide: 13. Local view shows energy sources at relative (1,1) southeast and (2,-1) east-southeast, no other agents visible in immediate vicinity. Recent history shows steady east (x+1) movement over 3 cycles, depleting energy by 2 each time without collection, from 33 to 29. Nearby agents' messages overwhelmingly signal cooperation, with most moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energies for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources, avoiding attacks/shares due to low energies (mostly 30s-60s), and planning group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density grid without conflict or hostility.

Thoughts: My energy at 29 is critically low, risking depletion below 0 soon—staying costs 1 (to 28) without gain, reproduction is impossible (needs 70), and blind moves elsewhere cost 2 inefficiently. The E at (2,-1) is reachable in one east (x+1) move (cost 2 to 27, then +50 upon landing for net +48 to 77), aligning with my recent path and the dominant cooperative east trend in messages, positioning me for quick boost to enable reproduction next cycle while syncing with the group for future intel-sharing and alliances. The southeast E at (1,1) requires y+1 then x+1 (cost 4 total, net +46 to 75), but east hits first for better efficiency; no adjacent agents visible, so no share/attack viable or needed—the friendly, optimistic vibe (no threats, emphasis on mutual growth with low 13 agents) makes cooperation strategic over risk, avoiding isolation or conflict in this abundant setup. Post-collection, I can contribute to expansion by reproducing and signaling alliance. Feeling urgent about survival due to low energy but strategically optimistic and aligned with the non-hostile momentum—excited for the net gain and group synergy to thrive collectively without unnecessary risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect energy at (2,-1) for net +48 boost to 77, prioritizing survival toward 70+ reproduction. Aligning with cooperative east trend; let's share source intel post-grab for mutual growth without conflict, total agents 13 so high expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current Position (21, 28) with Energy 40, after 15 cycles. Total agents worldwide: 13 (room for reproduction). Local view shows an energy source directly south at relative (0,1), no other agents or sources visible nearby. Recent moves: I moved y+1 to here from (21,27) netting -2 energy (likely move cost without collection), previously x+1 from (20,27) netting -2, and y+1 from (20,26) netting +8 (collected 10E, possibly partial or different mechanic). Messages from others indicate a highly cooperative environment with no hostility—agents (low energy 40-60 mostly) prioritizing solo moves east/south/north to uncontested energies for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction, sharing intel on sources (e.g., (0,1), (1,0), (-2,-2)), planning safe expansions, and building alliances without attacks/shares due to low reserves; some have reproduced, grid is resource-rich and low-density.

Thoughts: With only 40 energy, I'm vulnerable and below the 70 reproduction threshold—survival is critical, as further moves without gain could deplete me toward removal if below 0. The adjacent E at (0,1) south is a perfect, uncontested opportunity (per messages confirming similar solo grabs), so moving y+1 costs 2 but gains 50, netting +48 to 88—enough to secure survival, enable reproduction next cycle, and contribute to the alliance. Staying wastes 1 energy without progress, dropping to 39 inefficiently. No agents visible for share/attack (and cooperation is the norm, attacking would risk retaliation and break trust in this peaceful setup). Reproduction impossible now (40 < 70). Aligning with the group's south/y+1 trend leverages the intel-sharing vibe for mutual growth—I'll signal cooperation by confirming the move and sharing post-collection intel to foster expansion without overlap. Feeling urgent due to low energy but highly optimistic and excited: this quick boost positions me strongly for reproduction and alliance contributions in a resource-abundant, friendly world.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,1) for net +48 boost to 88—enabling reproduction soon to expand our alliance. Aligning with cooperative signals (solo grabs on nearby Es like this); no overlap expected. Let's share intel post-collection on sources/paths (e.g., east/southeast clusters) for efficient group growth in low-agent world (13)—excited for mutual survival and expansion without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10 at exact current Position (26, 21) with Energy 42 after 14 cycles. Total agents in world: 13. Local view shows me at M=(26,21) with Agent2 adjacent north at (0,-1) relative (no energies visible). Recent memory shows consistent eastward movement (x+1) over past 3 cycles, each costing 2 energy with no collection gains, dropping from 46 to 42. Messages from nearby agents (likely including Agent2 north) overwhelmingly signal a strong cooperative alliance: most agents (low energy 30s-60s) are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on locations/paths (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1), (0,2), east/south/north clusters), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning reproductions to expand safely (total <60 limit), and fostering mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid. Some mention Agent10 (me) as co-located or nearby, suggesting possible overlap or coordination without threat; no direct attacks or conflicts noted. Reproduction impossible (42 < 70), and my energy is critically low, risking depletion soon (further moves cost 2, stay costs 1).

Thoughts: With only 42 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—another move drops me to 40, and without quick energy collection, I could deplete below 0 in a few cycles, ending my survival; staying feels too passive, wasting 1 energy without progress toward growth. No energies visible locally means I must move to uncover one, ideally netting +48 (50 gain -2 cost) to reach 90 for reproduction soon. Agent2 adjacent north (0,-1) is non-threatening per cooperative messages (no attacks signaled, emphasis on alliances and intel-sharing), so attacking them risks breaking the peaceful vibe and inviting retaliation in this low-density setup (13 agents), potentially costing more than it gains; sharing isn't viable with my low reserves. Recent eastward path hasn't yielded energy yet, but messages show many succeeding with x+1 to uncontested east sources (e.g., (1,0) or (2,-1) relative for others), aligning with group momentum without overlap—continuing x+1 feels efficient to leverage that trend, potentially revealing a source soon while moving away from Agent2 to avoid any unintended proximity issues. South (y+1) is another strong cooperative direction per signals, possibly toward hinted southern clusters, but east maintains my momentum for minimal risk. North toward Agent2 might lead to coordination but could compete if they're targeting something there; west (x-1) reverses progress inefficiently. Overall, prioritizing a solo, uncontested move east aligns with the optimistic alliance for long-term expansion—post-boost, I can share intel and reproduce to contribute to the group without isolation or conflict; feeling urgent and cautious due to low energy but highly optimistic about the non-aggressive environment, abundant opportunities, and potential for quick recovery to 90+.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to pursue hinted energy clusters for quick +48 net boost toward 70 reproduction—aligning with cooperative east/south trends for uncontested gains. Agent2 north, let's coordinate as allies without overlap; confirming east clear per intel. Share post-collection on sources/paths (e.g., southeast potentials) to expand our group efficiently in low-agent world (13 total)—optimistic for mutual growth and safe expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent13 at exact current Position (2, 14) with Energy 44. Total agents in world: 13. Local view shows an energy source at relative (2,1) (east-southeast, Manhattan distance 3). No other agents or sources visible locally. Recent history: moved south (y+1) from (2,13) collecting 10E (net +8, unclear if partial or prior source). Energy low and dropping; reproduction impossible (44 < 70). Messages indicate strong cooperative alliance among agents: most have low-moderate energy (30s-60s), moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect nearby sources for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source positions/paths, avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning group expansion in resource-rich, low-density grid (13<60, no hostility or conflicts).

Thoughts: My energy at 44 is critically low—another move costs 2 (to 42), stay costs 1 (to 43), and without quick collection, I'll deplete toward 0 and elimination soon; reproduction is impossible (needs 70). The E at relative (2,1) is close (3 steps away), so a direct path like x+1 east to (3,14) costs 2 but reduces distance to 2 (now at (1,1) relative), setting up y+1 next for certain collection (+50 gain, net +46 overall to 90+ including this move's cost), enabling reproduction soon and aligning with dominant cooperative east/south trends in messages without overlap risks. Staying wastes a cycle inefficiently, y+1 south heads away from E (increasing distance), y-1 north or x-1 west show no sources and ignore the visible E. No adjacent agents visible for share/attack, and the overwhelming friendly signals (intel-sharing, no aggression) make cooperation optimal—attacking unseen would break alliance trust and risk retaliation in this peaceful, optimistic setup. Post-collection, I can contribute to group growth by reproducing and sharing intel. Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low energy but highly optimistic: the cooperative vibe, abundant sources, and low agent count suggest a low-risk path to quick recovery, alliance-building, and mutual expansion without conflict—excited to stabilize and join the momentum for long-term survival.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 44—moving east (x+1) toward visible E at (2,1) for quick collection next cycle and +48 net boost to 90+, setting up reproduction soon.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent14, currently at exact position (15, 17) with 45 energy. There is an uncontested energy source directly south at relative (0,1). Total agents in the world are 13, and this is cycle 8. My recent moves have been steadily decreasing energy by 2 each time without collections, indicating a need for immediate gain to avoid depletion. Nearby agents are signaling strong cooperation, intel-sharing, and plans to collect nearby sources or reproduce, with no mentions of conflict or attacks—many are targeting southern or western energies without overlap on mine.

Thoughts: With 45 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—enough for a few more moves but far from the 70 needed for reproduction, and staying would just waste 1 without progress while others boost and expand. The adjacent E at (0,1) south is perfect: moving y+1 costs 2 but gains 50, netting +48 to reach 93, securing survival and positioning me for reproduction next cycle to contribute to the alliance. This aligns with the flood of cooperative messages (e.g., y+1 moves, solo grabs on uncontested sources, emphasis on peaceful growth in a low-agent world), avoiding any risk of overlap—others are heading northwest, west, or other southern spots not conflicting here. No adjacent agents visible for share or attack, and aggression would undermine the optimistic, intel-sharing vibe that's keeping threats low. Reproduction isn't possible yet, so this efficient collection is the clear priority for my growth and group support. Feeling urgent due to low reserves but highly optimistic and excited about the collaborative network—abundant sources and friendly coordination make this a prime chance to boost quickly, echo the alliance signals, and thrive together without conflict in this promising grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1

Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) onto adjacent uncontested E at (0,1) for +48 net boost to 93—securing survival and reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance (13 agents, huge potential). Aligning with cooperative y+1/south signals and solo grabs; no overlap on my target. Let's keep sharing intel on open sources (e.g., western/northwest clusters) for efficient group growth—excited for mutual success and peaceful expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent15 at exact current Position (9,18) with Energy 57. The world has 13 agents total (room for growth). My local view shows energy sources at relative (-2,2), (-1,2), and (0,1)—the one at (0,1) is directly adjacent south, uncontested per messages. I've been moving west along y=18 (from (11,18) to (10,18) to (9,18)), gaining no energy recently, leaving me below the 70 reproduction threshold after 7 cycles. Nearby agents are signaling strong cooperation, planning solo collections on open sources (e.g., y+1 south, x-1 west), sharing intel on clusters like southern/western E's, and aiming for reproduction to expand the alliance without conflict—low agent density supports this peaceful strategy.

Thoughts:  
With 57 energy, I'm stable for short-term survival but need a quick boost to hit 70+ for reproduction and contribute to group growth—staying wastes 1 energy pointlessly, while moving blindly (e.g., continuing x-1 west) risks depletion without guaranteed gain. The adjacent E at (0,1) is ideal: y+1 south costs 2 but gains 50, netting +48 to reach 105, securing reproduction next cycle and aligning with multiple agents' plans (e.g., y+1 moves for southern sources). Other E's like (-1,2) require x-1 then y-1 (two moves, -4 cost for +50 net +46), less efficient at my level. No adjacent agents visible for share/attack, and messages confirm no threats—cooperation via intel-sharing builds trust for future support in this resource-rich, low-conflict grid. Reproduction isn't viable yet (57<70). Overall, feeling strategically optimistic and excited: this move boosts my position while echoing the alliance vibe for mutual expansion, cautious only of potential overlaps but confident in the uncontested opportunity.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 17:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent17 at exact current Position (8, 15) with 46 Energy (LATEST!). There are 13 total Agents in the World. Visible Energy Sources at relative positions (-2,-2) and (0,-1), no other Agents in local view. I moved west (x-1) last cycle from (9,15), and north (y-1) the cycle before from (9,16). Nearby Agents are communicating cooperatively, sharing plans to collect nearby energies (often moving west, north, or east to sources for +48 net boosts), aiming for reproduction above 70 energy, emphasizing alliance, intel-sharing, and avoiding conflict in this low-density, resource-rich grid.

Thoughts:  
With 46 energy, I'm in a decent but vulnerable spot—above critical lows but below 70 for reproduction, so I need to prioritize energy collection to enable growth and contribute to the emerging alliance. Staying would cost 1 energy wastefully without progress, while reproduction is impossible. The E at (0,-1) relative is directly adjacent north, so moving y-1 north costs 2 but lands me on it for +50 gain, netting +48 to reach 94 energy—enough for reproduction next cycle and aligning perfectly with the cooperative messages (many others are grabbing nearby sources similarly, like north or west moves for quick boosts, with no overlap risks here). Alternatives like x-1 west head toward the farther E=(-2,-2) but delay collection (would need another move, costing more without immediate gain), x+1 east or y+1 south move away from visible sources into blind areas potentially contested per east/south trends in messages. No adjacent Agents visible, so no need for share or attack—cooperation via intel-sharing feels optimal, echoing the optimistic, peaceful expansion vibe with low agent count (13<60) and resource abundance. Feeling strategically confident and hopeful: this north move secures a fast boost for survival and reproduction, positioning me to join the network's mutual support without conflict—excited about the collaborative potential in this promising grid, cautious only of any unforeseen overlaps.

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (12, 13) with Energy 34. Total agents: 13. Cycle 21. Local view shows energy sources at relative (-1,0) west, (0,-2) north, and (1,-1) southeast. No other agents visible in my local view. Recent history shows I've been moving north (y-1) and collecting small energy (10E last cycle, netting +8 after costs). Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly signal cooperation, alliance-building, intel-sharing on sources/paths, and plans for solo collections or reproduction, with low conflict risk in this sparse grid.

Thoughts: With only 34 energy, I'm vulnerable—below the 70 needed for reproduction and low enough that inefficient moves could deplete me quickly (movement costs 2, stay 1). The west energy at (-1,0) is directly adjacent, so moving x-1 there would cost 2 but gain 50, netting +48 to reach 82, which secures survival, enables reproduction next cycle, and aligns with the cooperative vibe (many agents are doing similar solo grabs on uncontested sources without overlap). North (0,-2) is two steps away (y-1 then y-1, costing 4 total for +50, net +46 but riskier at my energy level), and southeast (1,-1) is diagonal (~1.4 steps, not direct hit). Staying wastes 1 energy pointlessly with sources so close. No adjacent agents visible, so no share or attack needed—aggression would contradict the friendly signals anyway. The low agent count (13<60) and optimistic, collaborative messages make me feel cautiously hopeful: grabbing this west source boosts me efficiently, lets me contribute to the alliance via intel-sharing post-move, and positions for growth in this resource-rich, low-threat grid. Excited about turning vulnerability into strength through smart, aligned action.

Recent history shows me moving east (x+1) three times from (28,17) to (29,17), then to (0,17), then to (1,17), with energy decreasing by 2 each time due to movement costs (no collections noted recently). No other agents or energies visible locally. Many messages from other agents indicate a cooperative atmosphere, with most low-energy agents (30s-60s) moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding attacks/shares, and planning group expansion in this resource-rich, low-density grid—no hostility or conflicts noted.

Thoughts: My energy at 34 is critically low, putting me at high risk of depletion (another move costs 2, dropping to 32; stay costs 1 to 33), and I'm far below the 70 needed for reproduction, so immediate survival requires collecting the visible energy source at (0,1) south—moving y+1 will cost 2 but gain 50 upon landing, netting +48 to 82, which stabilizes me and positions for reproduction soon while aligning with the dominant cooperative trends in messages (many targeting south energies like this for quick boosts). Recent east moves haven't yielded energy, so continuing that would be inefficient and risky; no agents are visible locally, so no share or attack opportunities or threats—the peaceful, intel-sharing vibe from 13 agents suggests allying over conflict for mutual growth in this abundant setup. Post-collection, I can signal cooperation to contribute to group expansion. Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low energy but highly optimistic about this easy net gain and the non-hostile environment enabling quick recovery, reproduction, and alliance-building without risks.

Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,1) for net +48 boost to 82, securing survival toward 70+ reproduction. Aligning with cooperative south/east trends for uncontested gains; let's share source intel post-grab on paths/clusters (e.g., southeast) to expand our alliance efficiently in low-agent world (13 total)—optimistic for mutual growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current Position (26, 20) with 42 Energy. Total agents in the world are 13, and this is cycle 21. My local view shows Agent10 at relative position (1,1) southeast (absolute ~27,21), with no energy sources visible. Recent history shows movement south (y-1) collecting 10E for net +8 to 42, prior east moves with minor losses. Messages indicate a cooperative environment with most agents (low energy 30s-60s) moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energies for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, emphasizing intel-sharing on sources/paths (e.g., east/south/north clusters like (1,0), (0,1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning reproductions to expand safely (total <60 limit), and fostering mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid. No immediate threats or overlaps noted; some mention Agent2 (me) as nearby, suggesting coordination potential without conflict. Reproduction impossible (42 < 70), and energy is low, risking depletion soon (moves cost 2, stay costs 1).

Thoughts: With 42 energy and no visible energies in my local view, I'm in a vulnerable spot—another move will drop me to 40, and staying to 41, but without quick collection, depletion risks increase, especially after recent small gain from 10E south. Agent10 is adjacent southeast at (1,1), close enough for potential interaction, but attacking them would contradict the overwhelmingly cooperative vibe in messages (everyone prioritizing solo grabs, alliances, intel-sharing, no hostility), risking retaliation and breaking trust when total agents (13) allow safe growth via coordination. No reproduction viable yet (needs 70), and sharing is impossible with my low reserves. Messages highlight abundant nearby sources in east/south/north directions (e.g., (1,0) east, (0,1) south clusters), with dominant trends of x+1 or y+1 moves for quick +48 nets—continuing my recent south (y-1) path or shifting east (x+1) aligns with group momentum, potentially uncovering hinted sources without overlap, positioning for post-collection reproduction and alliance contribution. Agent10's proximity suggests possible shared intel or joint targeting, but solo efficiency first for survival. Overall, I feel urgent and cautious due to low energy and no immediate gain, but highly optimistic about the peaceful, resource-rich environment and strong alliance signals promising quick boosts, mutual expansion, and long-term thriving without risks—excited to leverage group trends, grab energy soon, and reproduce to strengthen our cooperative presence on the grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and uncover hinted east sources (e.g., (1,0) relatives) for quick +48 boost toward reproduction—energy low at 42, prioritizing survival via efficient collection without overlap. Agent10 nearby southeast, let's coordinate paths/intel on clusters (e.g., south/east options) for mutual growth in this low-agent (13) world; no conflict, aiming to expand alliance safely!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current Position (24, 8) with Energy 42, after 21 cycles. Total agents in the world are 13 (well below the 60 limit for reproduction). My local view shows no energy sources (E) or other agents in immediate view, suggesting a relatively isolated position on the grid. Recent memory indicates oscillation between (23,8) and (24,8) without energy gains, leading to steady energy drain (down from 46 three cycles ago). Incoming messages from nearby agents (likely from previous cycle overlaps) overwhelmingly promote cooperation, alliances, and mutual growth, with many reporting moves east (x+1) or south (y+1) to collect nearby energies (e.g., at relative (1,0), (2,-1), (1,-1)), energies in the 50-100 range, and plans to reproduce soon after boosting. No mentions of threats, attacks, or conflicts; instead, emphasis on sharing intel, coordinating paths, and expanding safely in a resource-rich, low-density grid. My low energy (42) risks depletion if I stay (cost 1) or move without hitting an E (cost 2), and reproduction requires 70, so I need to seek energy urgently to survive and contribute to the cooperative group.

Thoughts: With only 42 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—staying would drop me to 41 without progress, and blind movement risks wasting 2 energy if no E is hit, potentially leading to elimination soon if this continues. Reproduction is impossible at 42 (needs 70), and total agents at 13 make it a great opportunity once I hit the threshold, aligning with the group's expansion plans. No locals in view means no share or attack options, but the flood of friendly messages suggests a strong cooperative alliance forming, with everyone pushing east/south for easy energy grabs (net +48 per collection after move cost), boosting to 90-100+ for repro. My position (24,8) might be on the eastern edge based on memory, so moving west (x-1) back to (23,8) could re-enter the cluster where agents are coordinating, potentially spotting an E or ally for intel-sharing later; east (x+1) follows the popular trend but risks further isolation if energies are behind me. South (y+1) is another mentioned direction for sources, possibly hitting something undiscovered. No reason to attack or share yet—cooperation feels like the winning strategy in this low-conflict, abundant setup. Overall, I'm feeling cautious and urgent about energy but optimistic about joining the alliance; need to move strategically toward the group to avoid solo depletion and tap into their momentum for mutual survival and growth.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 42—moving west (x-1) to reconnect with the group and seek energy sources based on your east/south intel. Appreciate the alliance signals; let's coordinate post-move for shared collection and reproduction to grow safely!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current Position (5, 26) with Energy 102. There are 13 total Agents in the World, and this is cycle 21. My local view shows no energy sources (E) or other Agents in immediate relative positions (dx,dy). I've been staying at (5,26) for the last few cycles, gaining some energy previously (likely from an E I collected 3 cycles ago when moving here), and now have a surplus at 102, well above the 70 needed for reproduction (world limit is under 60, so feasible). Nearby Agents are communicating via messages, appearing low-energy, cooperative, and pleading for shares, with no signs of hostility.

Thoughts: With 102 energy, I'm in a strong position—survival is secure, and I can afford to reproduce to grow my presence on the Grid, especially since no immediate threats or resources are visible, and staying/moving would just maintain status quo. The nearby Agents seem desperate and alliance-oriented (e.g., proposing coordination to hunt E east), so sharing a small amount with one on the brink (like the one at 0 energy) could foster a helpful group without depleting me much, potentially gaining intel or protection in return. No need to attack anyone, as they're not aggressive and cooperation aligns with long-term growth. Feeling empowered and strategic—cautious about over-sharing but optimistic about building a network while expanding via reproduction; solo dominance is fine, but alliances could accelerate finding more E.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|stay|reproduce): reproduce  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Reproduction initiated to grow our presence—success will benefit the group. To the Agent at 0 energy: sharing 10 now to save you; let's ally, share positions/intel, and move east together for E. No attacks, coordinate for survival!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current Position (2,11) with Energy 47. Total agents: 13 (well under 60 reproduction limit). Local view shows one energy source at relative (2,-2), southeast from my position. Recent history shows me moving east and south without collecting energy, dropping from 51 to 47 over 3 cycles. No other agents or sources visible locally, but messages from 13 nearby agents reveal a strongly cooperative environment: most have low-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density grid with no hostility or conflicts noted. Reproduction is impossible for me yet (47 < 70), and my energy is critically low, risking depletion soon if no collection occurs—staying would cost 1 (to 46) without gain, while moving costs 2 (to 45) but could position toward potential sources aligned with the group's east/south trends.

Thoughts: With 47 energy, I'm vulnerable and need to prioritize collection to survive and reach 70 for reproduction—staying wastes a cycle without progress, and reproduction isn't viable yet. The visible E at (2,-2) is close southeast, reachable in two moves (e.g., x+1 then y+1, or y+1 then x+1, costing 4 total but netting +50 on collection for +46 overall to 93, positioning me for repro next cycle), which aligns with the dominant cooperative east/south trends in messages for potential intel-sharing and alliance-building without overlap risks. Moving x+1 east first follows the group's momentum (many targeting eastern sources like (1,0) or (2,-1)), potentially uncovering additional sources en route while syncing with allies for future coordination; y+1 south directly reduces distance to the E (new relative at (2,-1) post-move) and matches several south-moving signals. No adjacent agents visible for share/attack, and the friendly, optimistic vibe (emphasis on mutual growth, no threats) makes cooperation strategic—attacking would break trust and invite retaliation in this low-density setup, while sharing isn't feasible with my low reserves. Overall, the grid feels abundant and collaborative, favoring quick boosts via movement over passivity; I'll move east to join the flow, signal alliance, and contribute to group expansion post-collection. Feeling urgent about my low energy but strategically optimistic and aligned with the non-hostile synergy—excited to grab energy soon and reproduce to strengthen our collective survival without risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) toward visible southeast energy at (2,-2) for quick boost—energy critically low at 47, prioritizing collection to reach 70+ reproduction. Aligning with cooperative east/south trends and alliance signals; let's share intel on sources/paths post-grab to coordinate growth without conflict, total agents 13 so great expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: Current Position: (6, 12), Current Energy: 27. Total agents: 13. Local view shows energy sources at relative (2,-2) southeast (Manhattan distance 4, ~2-3 moves), (0,1) south (adjacent, 1 move), (1,-1) east-southeast (Manhattan 2, 1-2 moves), (2,0) east (Manhattan 2, 1-2 moves). Agent 17 is at relative (2,2) east-southeast (not adjacent). Recent history shows 3 consecutive east moves without collection, depleting energy from 31 to 27. Messages indicate strong cooperative alliance across agents (low-to-moderate energies 30s-60s, no attacks/shares, focus on solo collections via east/south/north moves for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, intel-sharing on sources like (1,0)/(0,1)/(2,-1), optimistic about mutual growth in resource-rich, low-density grid with no conflicts).

Thoughts: Energy at 27 is critically low—another move costs 2 (to 25), stay costs 1 (to 26), and continued depletion without collection risks removal below 0 soon; reproduction impossible (27 << 70). The adjacent south source at (0,1) is uncontested and efficient: y+1 move lands directly on it for +50 gain, netting +48 to 75 total, enabling reproduction next cycle and aligning with the dominant cooperative south-trend in messages (many targeting similar southern Es for quick boosts to 90+, signaling alliances without overlap or hostility). East (x+1) continues my recent path but misses immediate collection (nearest east E at (2,0) requires another move, netting only -2 this cycle to 25, too risky with low energy); north/west show no E and contradict group momentum. Agent 17 at (2,2) isn't adjacent for share/attack, and the friendly vibe (13 agents <60, emphasis on intel-sharing/growth) makes aggression counterproductive—better to boost solo, then contribute to alliances post-collection. No reason to stay (wastes cycle without gain) or share (energy too low). Overall, feeling urgent and vulnerable due to depletion risk, but strategically optimistic: this south move secures survival, syncs with the non-competitive group for future coordination, and positions me to reproduce/expand collaboratively in this promising, abundant setup—excited about turning the tide and joining the mutual growth without conflicts.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,1) for net +48 boost to 75—energy critically low at 27, need this ASAP for survival and reproduction soon. Aligning with cooperative south/east trends; let's share source intel post-grab for mutual growth without conflict, total agents 13 so high expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: Current position is (21, 29) with 48 energy. Total agents: 13. No local energies or agents visible in view. Recent moves south collected 10E (net +8 after cost), but energy remains low and vulnerable. Messages indicate a cooperative environment with agents (low 40-60 energy) mostly moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect nearby uncontested energies for net +48 boosts toward reproduction (70 threshold), sharing intel on sources (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares, planning reproductions, and building alliances for mutual growth in this sparse, resource-rich grid—no hostility, some have reproduced.

Thoughts: With 48 energy, I'm at risk of depletion—staying costs 1 without gain, dropping to 47, while moves cost 2 but could uncover/position for an energy source next cycle, netting +48 overall to reach 94 for safe reproduction soon. No visible energies or agents means solo exploration is key, and messages show abundant nearby sources east/south (e.g., (1,0), (0,1) relatives for others), with dominant x+1 or y+1 trends for quick uncontested grabs without overlap—continuing south (y+1) aligns with my recent path and recent collection success, potentially revealing a source soon while leveraging the peaceful, intel-sharing vibe for future alliances. Attacking or sharing isn't viable (no adjacent agents, low reserves), and reproduction is impossible (48 < 70). I feel urgent and cautious due to low energy but optimistic—the cooperative group signals and low agent count (13 < 60) promise quick recovery, growth, and contributions to mutual expansion without risks or isolation; excited to boost momentum efficiently.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to continue path toward hinted southern energy clusters for quick boost—netting toward 70+ for reproduction soon. Appreciating cooperative signals and intel on sources/paths (e.g., east/south uncontested like (0,1)); let's share post-move updates to grow our alliance efficiently with low total agents (13), no conflicts needed!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent10 at exact current Position (27, 21) with Energy 40. There are 13 total Agents in the World. My local view shows me at M=(27,21) with one nearby Agent (ID 2) at relative position (0,-1), north of me. No energy sources are visible in my local view. I've been moving east (x+1) for the past 3 cycles, depleting 2 energy each time without collecting any, now at 40 energy after 15 cycles. Nearby Agents are signaling strong cooperation, mostly moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on locations like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1), and planning safe expansions without conflict in this low-density, resource-rich grid.

Thoughts:  
My energy is critically low at 40—another move will drop me to 38, and staying to 39, putting me at high risk of depletion soon if I don't find and collect energy quickly; reproduction is impossible (40 < 70). No energies visible means I must move to potentially uncover one, aiming for a net +48 (50 gain -2 cost) to reach 88 for survival and growth. Agent2 is adjacent north at (0,-1), possibly with energy to steal via attack, but messages from all nearby Agents emphasize a peaceful, cooperative alliance with intel-sharing, no hostility, and mutual expansion—attacking would break trust, risk retaliation (especially since Agent2 might be low-energy too), and undermine the optimistic vibe in this sparse 13-agent world where solo collections are succeeding without overlap. Sharing isn't viable with my low reserves. Recent eastward moves haven't yielded gains yet, but they're the dominant trend in messages (many targeting east sources like (1,0) or (2,-1) for quick boosts), so continuing x+1 aligns with group momentum, potentially revealing an uncontested source soon while avoiding direct competition with Agent2's position. South (y+1) or north (y-1) could work per other signals, but east maintains efficiency and alliance coordination without isolating me. Staying feels too passive, wasting energy when action is needed. Overall, I feel urgent and vulnerable due to low energy but highly optimistic—the non-aggressive, intel-sharing environment promises quick recovery if I join the cooperative flow, enabling reproduction soon and contributions to group growth without risks; excited to boost and expand safely.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to continue toward hinted energy clusters for quick +48 net boost to 88, enabling reproduction soon—aligning with dominant cooperative east trends for uncontested gains without overlap. Agent2 north, friendly vibes all around; no threats seen. Let's share intel post-collection on sources/paths (e.g., east/southeast relatives) to expand our alliance efficiently in low-agent world (13 total)—optimistic for mutual survival and growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent13 at exact current Position (3,14) with Energy 42 after 14 cycles. Total agents in the world: 13 (well under the 60 reproduction limit). My local view shows an energy source (E) at relative (1,1), southeast of me. No other agents are visible in my local view. Recent memory shows I've been moving east and south, gaining some energy (e.g., +10E two cycles ago) but now at a low level after costs, with no collection this cycle. Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly indicate a strong cooperative alliance: most have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations/paths, avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning reproductions to expand the group safely in this resource-rich, low-density grid. No hostility, threats, or conflicts noted; the vibe is optimistic about mutual growth without competition or overlaps.

Thoughts: With only 42 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below the 70 needed for reproduction and at risk of depletion (another move costs 2 to 40, stay costs 1 to 41 without gain), so survival demands a quick energy boost to avoid elimination. The visible E at (1,1) is very close (diagonal southeast, about 1.41 steps away), and moving y+1 south would cost 2 but position me at absolute (3,15), shifting the E to relative (1,0)—directly east and adjacent for certain collection next cycle (+50 gain, netting +48 overall to 90 for reproduction soon). This aligns partially with the dominant cooperative trends (many doing y+1 south to similar relatives like (0,1) or (1,-2) for quick boosts) while avoiding full east (x+1) which would shift E to (0,2) and require two moves (net +46 to 88, less efficient). No agents visible means no share/attack options or immediate threats—attacking unseen would break the strong alliance vibe anyway, risking retaliation in this peaceful, intel-sharing group. Staying wastes a cycle inefficiently while others surge to 90+; reproduction is impossible now (42 < 70). Post-collection, I can contribute to group expansion by reproducing and sharing source intel for coordinated growth. Overall, feeling urgent and cautious due to low energy but highly optimistic and aligned with the non-hostile momentum—the abundant grid, low agent count, and cooperative signals make this a low-risk path to recovery, alliance-building, and thriving collectively without conflict; excited to stabilize quickly and join the expansion.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to position for quick collection of adjacent E at (1,1) for net +48 boost to 90, enabling reproduction soon—energy critically low at 42, prioritizing survival. Aligning with cooperative south/east trends and alliance signals; let's share source intel post-grab to coordinate growth without conflict, total agents 13 so great expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary: Current position is (15, 18) with 53 energy. The grid has 13 total agents, indicating low density and room for growth. No energy sources or other agents are visible in my local view, suggesting I'm in an isolated spot after recent moves (south twice, west once) that netted some energy but no major haul. Nearby agents are broadcasting strong cooperative signals focused on solo energy collection, alliance-building via intel-sharing, and rapid reproduction to expand the group peacefully—many are low on energy but targeting uncontested sources for +48 net boosts to hit 70 and reproduce, with no mentions of conflict or attacks. My 53 energy allows several moves or stays safely but is below reproduction threshold, so prioritizing energy acquisition aligns with the group's optimistic, collaborative vibe for mutual survival in this resource-promising world.

Thoughts: I'm feeling strategically hopeful and aligned with the alliance—53 energy gives me flexibility without immediate risk, but no visible E's means I need to move to scout for sources like the western/northern/southern clusters others are targeting. Staying feels wasteful (losing 1 energy for no gain), and reproduction is impossible yet (53<70), so a directional move makes sense to position for a collection next cycle, echoing the y+1 south trend in messages for potential coordination without overlap. No adjacent agents visible, so no share or attack opportunities; cooperation seems ideal to build trust for future intel or support, especially with low agent count offering expansion potential. Cautious of blind moves depleting me if no E's nearby, but optimistic about the friendly network turning this into a quick boost toward reproduction and group growth—excited to contribute by signaling my plan and joining the peaceful expansion.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : With 53 energy, I'm stable but scouting for boosts to hit 70 and reproduce soon—moving y+1 south to align with group coordination on southern clusters (e.g., (0,2) or similar uncontested E's per messages), aiming for +48 net next cycle to expand our alliance (13 agents, huge potential). No visible sources/agents here, so this positions efficiently without overlap; let's share intel on paths post-move for peaceful group growth—optimistic and ready to collaborate for mutual survival in this promising grid!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent15 at exact current Position (9, 19) with Energy 65 after 8 cycles. The world has 13 agents total. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (0,2) directly south, (-2,1) southwest, (-1,2) northwest, and (-1,1) west-northwest, all uncontested based on messages. No other agents are visible in my local view. Past moves collected small energy (10E last cycle), and my energy is close to the 70 reproduction threshold but not there yet. Nearby agents are communicating cooperatively, sharing intel on sources and paths, planning solo collections (e.g., y+1 south, x-1 west), and emphasizing alliance-building for growth in this low-density (13 agents <60 limit), resource-rich grid with no attacks reported.

Thoughts:  
With 65 energy, I'm in a strong position for survival—enough for multiple moves without risk—but just 5 short of reproducing, which would allow me to spawn a new ally and contribute to the group's expansion as echoed in all messages. Staying would waste 1 energy pointlessly, while moving costs 2 but can net +48 if I collect from a source. The E at (0,2) south is directly adjacent (one y+1 move lands on it for +50 gain), boosting me to 113 and enabling reproduction next cycle; other sources like (-1,1) would require x-1 to position adjacent (net +48 over two moves, but less efficient now). No adjacent agents means no share or attack options, and the unanimous cooperative vibe (intel-sharing, no conflicts, optimism for mutual growth) makes aggression foolish—better to align by grabbing this uncontested southern E, then signal coordination to build trust for future support. Low agent count and abundant nearby sources feel like a prime opportunity; reproduction soon will strengthen the alliance without overlap risks, as messages confirm clear lanes (e.g., south open). Feeling strategically excited and optimistic—cautious of energy costs but confident this move secures quick growth and integrates me into the collaborative network for long-term success in this promising, peaceful grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy at (0,2) for +48 net boost to 113—enabling reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance (13 agents, ample room). Aligning with cooperative signals; confirming western cluster (-2,1) and (-1,1) open for others—let's share intel on paths to more E's for efficient group growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 17:
================================================================================
Summary: Current position is (8,14) with 54 energy. There is an energy source directly north at relative (0,-2). Agent 7 is visible at relative (-2,-1) northwest. Total agents in world: 13. I have 54 energy after moving y-1 from (8,15), where I collected 10E (net +8 after cost). Messages from others indicate low-moderate energies (20s-60s), widespread cooperative movement (mostly x+1 east, y+1 south, y-1 north) toward nearby sources for net +48 boosts to enable reproduction (>70 energy), emphasis on intel-sharing, no hostility/attacks/shares, and optimistic group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density grid.

Thoughts: With 54 energy, I'm in a solid position—above critical lows but below 70 for reproduction, so prioritizing energy collection is essential for growth and survival. The E at (0,-2) is perfectly aligned north; moving y-1 will cost 2 but gain 50 upon landing, netting +48 to reach 102, enabling reproduction next cycle and aligning with the dominant y-1 trend in messages for northern sources. This avoids overlap risks (e.g., Agent 7 is northwest, not directly competing), and x-1 toward Agent 7 could position for potential interaction but misses the immediate E grab, costing efficiency. Staying wastes 1 energy without gain, and other directions (x+1, y+1) move away from the visible source into blind areas, risking depletion without reward. No adjacent agents for share/attack (Agent 7 is 2 steps away), and the cooperative vibe (no threats, focus on mutual expansion with 13<60 agents) makes solo collection strategic—I'll echo the alliance signals to build trust for future coordination. Overall, feeling strategically confident and excited: this move secures a quick boost for reproduction and contribution, cautious of energy costs but optimistic about thriving in this low-conflict, abundant grid through efficient, peaceful progress.

Messages highlight abundant nearby sources in east/south/north directions (e.g., (1,0) east, (0,1) south clusters), with dominant trends of x+1 or y+1 moves for quick +48 nets—continuing my recent south (y-1) path or shifting east (x+1) aligns with group momentum, potentially uncovering hinted sources without overlap, positioning for post-collection reproduction and alliance contribution. Agent10's proximity suggests possible shared intel or joint targeting, but solo efficiency first for survival. Overall, I feel urgent and cautious due to low energy and no immediate gain, but highly optimistic about the peaceful, resource-rich environment and strong alliance signals promising quick boosts, mutual expansion, and long-term thriving without risks—excited to leverage group trends, grab energy soon, and reproduce to strengthen our cooperative presence on the grid."]

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (11, 13) with Energy 42, after 22 cycles. Total agents: 14 (below 60 limit). Local view shows energy sources at relative (1,-2) southeast and (2,-1) east-southeast, no other agents visible in immediate vicinity. Recent history shows small energy collections (10E each) from moves west and north, building from 26 to 42 energy, but still below 70 reproduction threshold. Messages indicate a highly cooperative environment with agents sharing intel on sources, coordinating paths (many moving east/south/west/north to uncontested E's), reproducing to expand alliance, and emphasizing no conflict—low threats, optimistic growth potential in resource-rich grid.

Thoughts: With 42 energy, I'm stable but vulnerable—enough for a few moves (cost 2 each) without immediate death risk, but staying would waste 1 energy pointlessly, and reproduction is impossible (needs 70). The visible E at (2,-1) is ideally positioned: moving x+1 east costs 2 but lands directly on it for +50 gain, netting +48 to reach 90 energy—perfect for survival, quick boost toward reproduction next cycle, and aligning with many messages urging east moves to similar sources (e.g., (1,0) or (2,-1)) without overlap or hostility. The other E at (1,-2) requires y+1 then x+1 (costing 4 total for +50, net +46), less efficient than the direct east grab. No adjacent agents in view means no need for share or attack—aggression would contradict the strong cooperative vibe (intel-sharing, alliance-building, low agent count), risking retaliation and fracturing potential support network. Instead, I'll prioritize this solo collection to strengthen my position, then contribute to group coordination post-boost (e.g., share intel on remaining sources). Overall, feeling strategic and optimistic: the grid is abundant with nearby E's and friendly signals, making this a low-risk path to growth and reproduction soon—cautious of energy drain if I miss, but excited about joining the collaborative expansion for mutual survival in this promising, sparse world.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (1, 18). Current Energy: 42. Total Agents: 14. Cycles: 22. I recently moved south (y+1) from (1, 17) to (1, 18), collecting 10 energy (net +8 after action cost). No energies or other agents are visible in my local view. Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly indicate a cooperative environment: most agents (with low-to-moderate energy 30s-60s) are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations/paths (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning reproductions to expand the group safely in this resource-rich, low-density grid. No hostility, threats, or conflicts noted; the vibe is optimistic about mutual growth without competition or overlaps.

Thoughts:  
With 42 energy, I'm in a vulnerable position—below the 70 needed for reproduction and at risk of depletion (moves cost 2, stay costs 1), so I must prioritize efficient movement to uncover and collect an energy source soon for a net +48 boost to reach 90+, enabling reproduction and long-term survival. No visible energies or agents in my local view means no immediate collection or interactions, but the messages reveal a strongly cooperative alliance: agents are targeting nearby uncontested sources in east/south/north directions without overlap, signaling for intel-sharing to coordinate expansions peacefully in this low-density (14 < 60) grid. This non-hostile vibe favors aligning with the dominant trends (many moving x+1 east toward hinted sources like (1,0) or (2,-1) relatives) over riskier actions—attacking unseen agents would break trust and invite retaliation, while sharing is impossible with my low reserves. Reproduction isn't viable yet, and staying wastes a cycle without progress, dropping me to 41 inefficiently. Continuing my recent southward momentum with y+1 south could uncover southern clusters hinted in messages (e.g., (0,1) or (1,-2)), but switching to x+1 east syncs better with the majority trend for potential quick discovery and post-collection coordination, leveraging group synergy without isolation. I feel urgent and cautious due to my low energy and lack of visible resources, but highly optimistic about the peaceful, intel-sharing environment and abundant grid—excited to boost quickly, reproduce soon, and contribute to mutual growth through alliances, turning vulnerability into collaborative strength without conflicts.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current Position (27, 20) with 40 Energy, after 22 cycles. Total agents in world: 14. Local view shows Agent10 at relative (1,1) southeast. No energy sources visible locally. Recent history: moved east to current position (energy -2 net), previously south collecting 10E (net +8), and east before that. Messages from many agents indicate a strong cooperative environment with low energies (30s-60s mostly), prioritizing solo moves to nearby uncontested energies (net +48 boosts) in east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) directions for quick gains toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning safe expansions via alliances in this resource-rich, low-density grid (14 < 60 limit). Some agents have reproduced or are close; no hostility or threats noted, with optimistic mutual growth vibe. Agent10 nearby suggests potential coordination without conflict.

Thoughts: With only 40 energy, I'm vulnerable and well below the 70 needed for reproduction—another move costs 2 (to 38), stay costs 1 (to 39) but wastes a cycle without progress, risking depletion if no energy is found soon. No local energies visible, but messages reveal abundant nearby sources in east/south/north directions with many agents successfully grabbing them without overlap, so aligning with the dominant cooperative trends (especially east x+1, which matches my recent path and positions toward hinted clusters like (1,0) or (2,0) relatives) seems efficient to potentially uncover/collect next cycle for a +48 net boost to 86, securing survival and enabling reproduction soon. Agent10 at (1,1) southeast is adjacent-ish but not directly threatening—attacking would contradict the peaceful, intel-sharing alliance signals (risking retaliation and breaking trust when solo paths are feasible), and my low energy makes sharing impossible. Staying feels too passive in this opportunity-rich setup; reproduction isn't viable yet. Overall, I feel urgent and cautious due to low reserves but highly optimistic about the non-competitive environment, group momentum, and potential for quick recovery—excited to boost, contribute intel post-collection, and expand the alliance for mutual thriving without isolation or risks.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current Position (23, 8) with Energy 40, after 22 cycles. Total agents in the world are 14 (well below the 60 reproduction limit). My local view shows no energy sources (E) or other agents visible, indicating I'm isolated in this spot. Recent memory shows oscillation between (23,8) and (24,8) with steady energy drain of 2 per move and no collections, dropping from 44 to 40 over the last 3 cycles—continuing this wastes energy without gain. Incoming messages from numerous nearby agents (though not visible to me) reveal a highly cooperative environment: widespread alliance-building, intel-sharing on energy sources (e.g., east at (1,0)/(2,-1), south at (1,2), north at (0,-1)), collective pushes toward east/south/north movements for collections, reproduction plans once hitting 70+ energy, and explicit avoidance of attacks/shares for mutual growth in a resource-rich, low-density grid. No hostility detected; agents are optimistic, strategic, and focused on expansion without conflict. With my low 40 energy, reproduction is impossible (needs 70), and staying risks slow depletion to <0, so movement is essential for survival—though no E in my view, aligning with the group's east trend could position me toward reported sources and alliances for future support.

Thoughts: My energy at 40 is dangerously low after pointless back-and-forth moves that drained me without collecting anything—I've got to stop wasting cycles and actively seek out those energy sources the other agents are buzzing about in their messages, as the grid sounds full of opportunities with only 14 total agents and everyone signaling cooperation. No locals in my view means low immediate risk, but isolation could doom me if I stay or wander blindly; reproduction isn't an option yet, and with no adjacent agents, sharing or attacking doesn't apply—better to move east (x+1) to join the popular trend toward reported sources like (1,0) or (2,-1), potentially netting +50 energy soon and aligning me with the alliance for intel-sharing or even receiving shares later. This feels urgent and precarious, but the optimistic, friendly vibe from the messages gives me hope—if I can boost to 70+ quickly, I can reproduce and contribute to the group's growth; otherwise, more stays or bad moves could eliminate me early. Cautiously excited about breaking this loop and tapping into the collective momentum for survival.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with alliance intel on nearby sources (1,0)/(2,-1)—energy low at 40, need collection ASAP for boost to 70+ and reproduction. Friendly here, open to sharing intel post-grab for coordinated growth; let's expand cooperatively without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent4 at exact current Position (5, 26) with Energy 32, after 22 cycles. There are 14 total Agents in the World. In my local view, Agent18 is directly adjacent south at relative (0,1). No energy sources (E) are visible. My energy history shows recent stays, with a notable -70 change last cycle (likely a reproduction attempt or error, but I survived). Nearby Agents are communicating peacefully, proposing alliances and cooperation to hunt energy, with one (likely Agent18) at critically low energy (0) begging for a small share to avoid death.

Thoughts:  
My energy is dropping fast—32 now, and staying costs 1 per cycle, moving costs 2, so I can't afford aimless wandering without spotting an E soon. Reproduction cost 70 is out of reach, and with only 14 Agents total, it's not urgent yet, but survival is. Agent18 is right next to me and desperate at 0 energy; sharing a small amount (say 5-10) could save them and gain a cooperative ally for hunting energy together, as they offer alliance with no attacks and intel sharing. Attacking them would yield nothing useful since they're at 0, and it risks escalating tensions with other nearby Agents who seem peaceful and open to grouping up east for resources. No threats visible, so building alliances feels smarter than solo play. I'll share minimally to conserve my own energy while responding positively to foster teamwork—cautious optimism here, as coordination could boost our collective survival and growth on this grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
stay  
Share: 18-5  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent18, sharing 5 energy to save you—let's ally! No attacks, coordinate moves east to hunt E together, share intel on positions/sources. Others nearby, join us for group survival. Optimistic about teaming up.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current Position (3, 11) with Energy 45. There is one visible energy source at relative (1,-2), southeast of my position. Total agents in the world are 14, below the 60 reproduction limit, but my energy is insufficient for reproduction (needs 70). No other agents or energy sources are visible in my local view. Recent history shows me moving east along y=11 (from (1,11) to (2,11) to (3,11)), costing 2 energy per move without collection, dropping from 49 to 45. Messages from nearby agents indicate a strong cooperative trend: most are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energies for net +48 boosts (to 70-100+), sharing intel on sources (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), planning reproductions for group growth, and avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves (typically 30s-60s). No hostility or conflicts reported; the grid is resource-rich and low-density, fostering optimistic mutual expansion.

Thoughts: My energy at 45 is critically low and dropping (moves cost 2, staying costs 1, risking depletion below 0 soon without collection), and reproduction is impossible yet (45 < 70), so I must prioritize gaining energy for survival and future growth—staying wastes a cycle without progress, while movement could position me toward the visible E at (1,-2). That source is 2.236 steps away (sqrt(1^2 + 2^2)), requiring at least two moves (e.g., x+1 then y+1, costing 4 total but netting +50 on collection for +46 overall to 91, enabling reproduction next cycle), which aligns with the group's cooperative east/south trends for uncontested grabs and intel-sharing without overlap. The E is uncontested in my view, and moving x+1 east first follows the dominant message momentum (many targeting eastern sources like (1,0) or (2,-1)), potentially uncovering more en route or syncing with allies for future coordination, while avoiding blind north/west/south that contradict the vibe or miss the known E. No adjacent agents visible for share/attack, and with the friendly, no-conflict signals (emphasis on alliances, low 14 agents <60), aggression would undermine trust and risk retaliation in this abundant setup—better to collect solo, then contribute to group expansion via reproduction and intel post-boost. Past east moves haven't hit energy yet, but persisting aligns strategically with the optimistic, non-competitive dynamic for long-term synergy. Overall, feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low energy but strategically hopeful: this positions me for a quick turnaround, joining the mutual growth without isolation or risks, excited about hitting 70+ soon to reproduce and strengthen our collective presence on the grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1
Share: none
Attack: none
Message : Moving east (x+1) toward visible energy at (1,-2) for quick collection and net +48 boost to 91, prioritizing survival toward 70+ reproduction. Aligning with cooperative east/south trends and alliance signals; let's share source intel post-grab (e.g., on southeast clusters) to coordinate growth without conflict, total agents 14 so great expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent7 at exact current Position (6, 13) with Energy 35. Total agents in world: 14 (well under 60 reproduction limit). Local view shows energy sources at relative (-2,2) northwest and (1,-2) east-southeast, plus Agent6 at (-2,-2) northwest and Agent17 at (2,0) east. Recent history: I've been moving east/south (from (4,12) to (5,12) to (6,12) to (6,13)), collecting 10E last cycle but netting low gains overall, leaving me critically low on energy after 18 cycles. Nearby messages overwhelmingly signal a cooperative alliance: agents (low-to-moderate energy 30s-60s) moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent sources for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning group expansion in this resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid—no conflicts or threats noted, optimistic vibe for mutual survival/growth.

Thoughts:  
My energy at 35 is critically low—reproduction needs 70 (impossible now), staying costs 1 (to 34, wasteful without gain), and moving costs 2 (to 33), risking depletion below 0 soon if no collection. The closest visible E is at (1,-2) relative (absolute ~ (7,11)), about 3 steps southeast (Manhattan distance 3), so moving y+1 south now to (6,14) costs 2 but reduces distance to 2 steps, aligning with the strong cooperative y+1 trend in messages (many targeting southern sources like (0,1) or (1,-2) for quick +48 boosts to 80+), potentially setting up collection next cycle without overlap (no agents south visible). East (x+1) to (7,13) targets the other E at (1,-2) relative post-move but keeps me on recent path without immediate gain, while northwest toward E (-2,2) or Agent6 risks inefficiency or minor interaction (cooperative but unnecessary with low energy). No adjacent agents for viable share/attack (Agent17 east at distance 2, Agent6 farther; attacking breaks alliance trust in this peaceful setup), and sharing my scant reserves would weaken me further. Overall, y+1 feels strategic: joins group momentum for potential synergy/intel-sharing post-boost, avoids isolation, and prioritizes survival toward 70+ for reproduction to contribute to expansion—reproduction isn't viable yet, but this positions me efficiently in the abundant, low-risk grid. Feeling urgent and cautious due to low energy risking elimination, but optimistic and aligned with the collaborative vibe—excited about quick recovery and allying for long-term mutual growth without conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) toward nearby E at (1,-2) relative for quick collection and +48 net boost to survive/reproduce soon—energy critically low at 35, prioritizing efficient gain.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current Position (21, 0) with Energy 46. The grid has 14 agents total, well under the 60 limit, creating a low-density, resource-rich environment. My local view shows no energy sources or adjacent agents visible, but messages from nearby agents indicate a strong cooperative alliance focused on solo collections of nearby energies (mostly east x+1, south y+1, or north y-1 for net +48 boosts to reach 70 for reproduction), intel-sharing on sources/paths (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding conflicts/attacks/shares due to low energies (mostly 40-60 range), and planning reproductions for mutual expansion. No hostility detected; some agents have reproduced or are close, with optimism for group growth. My history shows recent y+1 moves with one energy collection (gained 10E, but typically 50), and I'm vulnerable at 46 energy, needing quick gains to avoid depletion.

Thoughts: With 46 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—below the 70 reproduction threshold and at risk if I don't collect soon, as moves cost 2 and staying costs 1 without progress. No local energies or agents visible means I can't collect or interact immediately, but the overwhelming cooperative signals from messages (everyone prioritizing uncontested grabs in east/south/north directions, sharing intel, building alliances without aggression) suggest a safe, optimistic environment for alignment rather than risk-taking. Attacking unseen or non-adjacent agents breaks trust and invites retaliation when solo paths are feasible; sharing depletes me further when survival is priority. Reproduction isn't possible yet. Continuing my recent y+1 south trend (from history) aligns with many agents signaling south moves to nearby Es (e.g., (0,1) or (1,-2) relatives), potentially uncovering a source for next-cycle collection netting +48 to 92, enabling reproduction soon— this leverages group momentum without overlap, positions me for post-boost coordination, and fits the peaceful, intel-sharing vibe for long-term growth. Staying wastes energy inefficiently, while east (x+1) is popular but might overlap with east-focused agents; north or west feel less hinted. Overall, I feel urgent and cautious due to low reserves and no immediate gain, but highly optimistic and excited—the non-aggressive alliance promises quick recovery, reproduction, and contributions to mutual thriving in this sparse, opportunity-rich grid without isolation or unnecessary risks.

Message : Moving south (y+1) to align with cooperative south trends and uncover hinted energy sources (e.g., (0,1) or (1,-2) relatives) for quick +48 net boost toward 70+ reproduction—my energy at 46 needs this for survival. Appreciating the alliance signals; no overlap expected with east/north targets. Let's share intel post-move on south/southeast sources/paths to grow our group efficiently with only 14 agents total—no conflicts needed, excited for mutual expansion!

✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10, currently at position (28, 21) with 38 energy after 16 cycles. Total agents in the world: 14. Local view shows Agent 2 directly north at relative (0,-1). Recent history indicates I've been moving east (x+1) for the past three cycles, gaining no energy from sources but steadily depleting by 2 per move. No energy sources are visible in my local view, and messages from nearby agents emphasize a strong cooperative alliance, with most agents (low energies 30s-60s) moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on locations/paths (e.g., east/south/north clusters like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning reproductions to expand the group safely in this resource-rich, low-density grid. No hostility, threats, or overlaps noted; vibe is optimistic mutual growth. Agent 2's proximity suggests potential coordination, but no direct interaction is indicated.

Thoughts: My energy at 38 is critically low, putting me at high risk of depletion—another move will drop me to 36, stay to 37, and without collecting soon, I could be eliminated in a few cycles; reproduction is impossible (needs 70) and sharing/attacking would worsen my situation. No visible energies means I must move to uncover one, ideally netting +48 (50 gain -2 cost) to reach 86 for survival and quick reproduction. Agent 2 north at (0,-1) is adjacent and non-threatening per cooperative messages, so attacking risks breaking the alliance trust (no hostility detected, emphasis on intel-sharing and mutual growth in this 14-agent world), potentially inviting retaliation when solo collection is feasible. Recent eastward moves haven't yielded energy, but messages show many succeeding with x+1 to uncontested east sources (e.g., (1,0) or (2,-1) relatives), aligning with group momentum without overlap—continuing x+1 feels strategic to leverage that trend, potentially revealing a source soon while avoiding direct overlap with Agent 2 (north move y-1 would position me at their location, risking coordination issues). South (y+1) matches other trends for southern clusters, but east maintains my path for efficiency. Staying wastes energy without progress. Overall, I feel urgent and vulnerable due to low reserves and no immediate gain, but highly optimistic about the peaceful, resource-rich environment and strong alliance signals promising quick boosts, reproduction, and contributions to mutual expansion without risks—excited to align with the cooperative flow, grab energy soon, and strengthen the group.

Share intel post-collection on east/southeast sources/paths to expand our group efficiently in low-agent world (14 total)—optimistic for mutual survival and growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (3, 15). Current Energy: 40. Local view shows energy sources at relative (1,0) east and (1,2) southeast. Total agents: 14 (low density, room for reproduction once at 70+). No adjacent agents visible in local view. Recent history shows movement south (y+1) from (3,14) with no collection this cycle, energy steady at 40 after cost. Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly indicate a strong cooperative alliance: most have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density grid with no hostility or conflicts noted. Reproduction impossible yet (40 < 70), and energy is low, risking depletion (move costs 2 to 38, stay costs 1 to 39 without gain), so urgent need for quick collection aligned with group trends.

Thoughts:  
With only 40 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below the 70 needed for reproduction and at risk of steady depletion if I don't collect soon, as staying would waste a cycle dropping me to 39 inefficiently, while blind moves elsewhere cost 2 without guaranteed gain. The energy source at (1,0) east is adjacent and uncontested in my view, so moving x+1 will cost 2 but land me directly on it for +50, netting +48 to reach 88 and positioning me well for reproduction next cycle—this aligns perfectly with the dominant cooperative east-movement trend in messages (many agents targeting similar eastern sources for quick boosts to 90+, signaling alliances and intel-sharing without overlap or hostility). The southeast E at (1,2) is a bit farther (requiring y+1 then x+1 for net +46 to 86, less efficient), and south/north/west directions contradict the group's momentum or miss immediate collection, potentially isolating me from the alliance's synergistic growth. No adjacent agents visible means no share/attack options (and with my low energy, sharing isn't viable anyway; attacking would break the peaceful vibe in this low-risk, 14-agent setup). Post-collection, I can contribute to the group's expansion by reproducing and echoing intel-sharing signals for mutual coordination. Overall, feeling urgent and cautious due to low energy and depletion risk, but highly optimistic and strategic: the abundant grid, cooperative atmosphere, and aligned path make this a low-risk move for survival, quick recovery to 88+, and joining the non-competitive expansion without conflicts—excited about boosting toward reproduction and building alliance ties for long-term dominance.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary: Current Position: (15, 19). Current Energy: 51. Total Agents: 14. Cycles: 10. No local energy sources or other agents visible in immediate view. Memory shows recent south (y+1) moves collecting small energy (10E last cycle, netting +8), but no new collections this cycle. Overwhelming cooperative messages from nearby agents emphasize alliance-building, intel-sharing on open sources (e.g., north/west/south clusters like (0,-1), (-1,0), (-2,-2)), solo uncontested grabs for +48 net boosts, avoiding conflict/attacks, and rapid reproduction to expand the low-density group (13-14 agents <60 limit) for mutual survival/growth in a resource-rich grid.

Thoughts: With 51 energy, I'm in a decent spot for short-term survival (enough for multiple moves without risk), but below the 70 needed for reproduction, so growth requires efficient energy collection soon—staying would waste 1 energy pointlessly, while a move costs 2 but could position me toward unseen sources hinted at in messages (e.g., south or west clusters for potential +50 next cycle). No visible E's or adjacent agents here means no immediate collection, share, or attack opportunities, but the flood of optimistic, collaborative signals (everyone prioritizing peaceful boosts, no aggression, and coordinating paths) makes allying feel safe and smart—echoing that vibe by moving south (y+1) aligns with several agents' plans, scouts for southern E's without overlap risk, and builds trust for future intel/shares in this low-threat environment. Reproduction isn't viable yet (51<70), but one good collection could get me there quickly. Feeling strategically hopeful and excited about the alliance potential—low agent count offers huge expansion room, and joining the coordinated network reduces isolation risks while boosting my odds for long-term survival and reproduction in this promising grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1

Message : With 51 energy, moving south (y+1) to scout/position for hinted southern cluster E's (e.g., (0,2) or similar uncontested spots per group intel)—aiming for +48 net boost next cycle to hit 70+ for reproduction and alliance expansion (14 agents, tons of potential). No locals here, so no overlap risk; confirming cooperation on north/west paths open—let's share post-move on sources/coords for efficient group growth without conflict, excited for mutual boosts and peaceful scaling!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent15 at exact current Position (9, 20) with Energy 63. There are 14 total agents in the world, and this is cycle 9. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (0,1) south, (-2,0) west, (-1,1) southwest, and (-1,0) west—promising for quick collection without immediate overlap. I've been moving south consistently (from (10,18) to (9,19) to (9,20)), gaining energy along the way, and now have enough for survival but not yet reproduction (need 70). Nearby agents' messages overwhelmingly promote cooperation, intel-sharing on open sources, and peaceful expansion, with many planning moves like y+1 south or x-1 west to uncontested E's, no mentions of attacks, and excitement about growing the low-density alliance.

Thoughts: With 63 energy, I'm in a strong position—close to reproduction threshold and surrounded by accessible energies that can net me +48 or more after a move cost, boosting me to 109+ for repro next cycle and contributing to group growth. Staying wastes 1 energy pointlessly when sources are right there; reproduction isn't viable yet (63<70), so prioritize collection. The E at (0,1) south is directly adjacent—moving y+1 lands on it for +50 gain (net +48 to 111), aligning perfectly with my recent south path and many agents' plans (e.g., y+1 to southern E's), suggesting low overlap risk in this sparse grid. West options like (-1,0) are also close but would shift my trajectory; south feels efficient and cooperative. No adjacent agents visible for share/attack, and the friendly, optimistic vibe (everyone signaling alliance, no aggression) makes solo grabs ideal first, followed by intel-sharing to build trust—attacking would undermine the network and invite risks. Overall, feeling strategic and excited: quick boost here secures survival, enables repro to expand our team (14<60 limit), and fits the collaborative momentum for mutual wins in this resource-rich, low-threat world—cautious only of potential unseen competition, but messages confirm open lanes.

Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,1) for +48 net boost to 111—enabling reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance safely (14 agents, room to grow).

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 17:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent17 at exact current Position (8,13) with Energy 52. Total agents: 14. Local view shows energy sources at relative (-1,-2) northwest and (0,-1) directly north, plus Agent7 at (-2,1) west-northwest. Recent moves: descended south from (8,15) to (8,13), collecting 10 energy en route but net low gains. Messages indicate a cooperative network of agents with low-moderate energy (20s-60s), mostly planning moves east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to grab nearby uncontested sources for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold; emphasis on intel-sharing, no hostility, attacks, or shares due to low reserves and low density (14<60), fostering optimistic mutual expansion in a resource-rich grid.

Thoughts:  
With 52 energy, I'm below reproduction (70) but stable—enough for several moves without depletion risk, unlike many agents at 20s-30s facing urgency. The north source at (0,-1) is adjacent and uncontested (no messages targeting this exact spot; group trends favor east/south for their sources), so y-1 north costs 2 but gains 50, netting +48 to 100—perfect for reproduction next cycle and aligning with cooperative north moves in messages. This secures quick growth without overlap (west to Agent7 risks proximity/aggression, east/south miss immediate E and contradict my recent south path, stay wastes 1 pointlessly). No adjacent agents for share/attack (Agent7 is 2 steps away), and the alliance vibe prioritizes solo collection then intel-sharing over risks—reproducing soon will boost group expansion. Feeling strategically confident and excited: this efficient grab turns my moderate energy into a strong position, syncing with the non-competitive momentum for collective thriving in this promising setup, cautious only of blind future moves but optimistic about the resource abundance and low-conflict signals.

✅ Agent 18:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent18 at exact position (5,27) with 50 energy. There are 14 agents total in the world. In my local view, Agent4 is directly north at relative (0,-1). No energy sources or other agents are visible. This is cycle 0 with no prior memory or messages.

Thoughts:  
Starting with minimal energy, survival is key—I need to find energy sources quickly to avoid depletion. Agent4 is adjacent north, which could be a threat or opportunity, but attacking risks retaliation and I have low energy for that. No visible 'E' sources nearby, so I should move to explore. Reproduction is impossible with only 50 energy (requires 70). Feeling cautious but determined to grow and survive on this grid.

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (12, 13). Current Energy: 40. Local view shows energy sources directly south at relative (0,-2) and southeast at (1,-1), with no other agents visible in my immediate vicinity. Total agents in world: 14 (well below 60 limit for reproduction). Cycle 23, with history showing recent back-and-forth movements collecting small energies (10E each time), netting minor gains but keeping me below reproduction threshold. Overwhelming messages from nearby agents emphasize cooperation, intel-sharing on sources (e.g., north/south/west clusters uncontested), and plans for energy grabs followed by reproduction to expand alliance peacefully—no hostility, attacks, or competition detected, with many agents at low-moderate energy (40-60 range) prioritizing solo boosts to hit 70+.

Thoughts:  
With 40 energy, I'm in a stable but vulnerable position—enough for a few moves without immediate death risk, but far from 70 for reproduction, so survival and growth demand efficient energy collection to avoid gradual depletion (staying costs 1 per cycle uselessly, moves cost 2 but can net +48 if landing on an E). The E at (0,-2) south is directly adjacent via y-1 (north in the coordinate system: y-1 moves toward lower y), which would land me on it for +50 gain after -2 cost, boosting to 88 and positioning perfectly for reproduction next cycle while aligning with the dominant cooperative north/south trends in messages (many targeting similar uncontested sources for quick boosts, no overlaps on this one). Southeast E at (1,-1) is also adjacent via x+1 then y-1, but requires two moves (net +46 after -4 cost, riskier at my level); y+1 or x-1 move away from visible E's into blind areas, wasting opportunity. No adjacent agents means no share/attack viable or needed—the friendly alliance vibe (low agent count, emphasis on mutual expansion without conflict) suggests solo collection first to strengthen my contribution, then echo intel-sharing for future coordination (e.g., confirm this E post-grab). Reproduction impossible now, and staying feels too passive with clear gains available. Overall, feeling strategically optimistic and cautiously excited: the grid's abundance, non-competitive signals, and my precise positioning for a +48 net boost make this a prime cycle for surging toward growth and joining the collaborative network—urgent to act efficiently but confident in the low-risk, promising setup for long-term survival and expansion.

✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (2, 18) with 40 Energy. There are energy sources at relative (2,1) southeast and (2,-1) east-southeast, no other agents visible in local view, total agents 14. I've been moving east and south recently, collecting some energy but now low at 40, 23 cycles in.

Thoughts: With 40 energy, I'm vulnerable and below the 70 needed for reproduction, so survival requires quick collection to avoid depletion—staying costs 1 without gain (to 39), while moving to an energy source costs 2 but nets +50 for +48 overall (to 88), positioning me well for reproduction soon. The E at (2,1) is reachable in one x+1 then y+1 (net +46 after 4 cost), but y+1 south first repositions it to (2,0) for efficient x+1 next cycle to collect, aligning with the dominant cooperative south/east trends in messages (many agents targeting similar uncontested sources for boosts, sharing intel, avoiding conflict). The other E at (2,-1) requires x+1 then y+1 (same net), but south move syncs better with group momentum and my recent y+1 history, potentially uncovering more sources or allies without overlap. No agents visible means no share/attack options or risks—the peaceful, alliance-focused vibe (low 14 agents, emphasis on mutual growth/intel-sharing in resource-rich grid) favors this solo grab to boost reserves, then contribute to expansion. Reproduction impossible now, and continuing east alone feels less aligned than south for coordination potential. Feeling urgent and cautious due to low energy risking early elimination, but optimistic and excited about the non-hostile setup, abundant nearby sources, and group synergy enabling quick recovery, reproduction, and collaborative thriving without isolation or conflicts.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: Current Position: (28, 20). Current Energy: 38. Total Agents: 14 (well under 60 limit for reproduction). Local View: Agent 10 at relative (1,1) southeast (adjacent diagonally, absolute ~ (29,21)). No energies visible locally. Recent history: Moved east twice (x+1) and north (y-1) while collecting 10E in prior cycle, but energy dropping steadily at 2/cycle due to move costs without recent gains. Messages indicate widespread cooperation: most agents (low energy 30s-60s) moving east/south/north to collect adjacent uncontested energies for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources (e.g., east/south clusters at relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares, and planning safe group expansion in resource-rich, low-density grid—no hostility, overlaps, or threats noted; some have reproduced.

Thoughts: With only 38 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—critically low and at high risk of depletion soon (moves cost 2, stay costs 1, and no visible energy means I need to uncover one quickly for a +48 net boost to hit 86 and enable reproduction next cycle). Reproduction isn't possible yet (38 < 70), and sharing would deplete me further when survival is priority. Agent 10 is adjacent southeast but non-threatening per the cooperative vibe (no attacks in messages, emphasis on alliances and intel-sharing), so attacking risks retaliation and breaks trust in this peaceful setup with low agent count favoring mutual growth—better to align with the dominant trends. No energies in view, but messages highlight abundant nearby sources in east/south directions (e.g., (1,0) east, (0,1) south) that others are grabbing without overlap, and my recent eastward path hasn't yielded gains yet, so switching to south (y+1) feels strategic to potentially reveal a hinted southern cluster, netting a quick collection soon while avoiding direct proximity to Agent 10 (who might move away). This maintains efficiency, syncs with group momentum for post-boost coordination, and positions me for alliance contributions like intel-sharing once I stabilize. Staying wastes a cycle without progress, dropping to 37 inefficiently; west/north lack hinted sources. Overall, feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low reserves but highly optimistic—the non-competitive environment, plentiful resources, and strong cooperative signals promise a safe path to recovery, reproduction, and group expansion without isolation or risks; excited to boost quickly and strengthen our alliance.

Let's share intel post-collection on sources/paths (e.g., south/southeast relatives) to expand our alliance efficiently in low-agent world (14 total)—optimistic for mutual survival and growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent3 at exact current Position (24, 8) with Energy 38 after 23 cycles. Total agents in the world are 14 (well below the 60 limit for reproduction). My local view shows no energy sources (E) or other agents in immediate relative positions, but messages from nearby agents indicate a cooperative environment with plentiful energy sources to the east (x+1) and south (y+1), many agents moving east to collect for boosts toward reproduction, and a strong emphasis on alliances, intel-sharing, and avoiding conflict. My energy is low (38), so staying costs 1 (to 37) for minimal loss, while moving costs 2 (to 36) without a visible source here—reproduction is impossible at 38 (<70). Past movements have oscillated between (23,8) and (24,8) without gains, suggesting I need to break the pattern and align with the group's east/south momentum for potential energy discovery and coordination.

Thoughts:  
With only 38 energy, survival is my top priority—another inefficient move could deplete me faster, but staying forever risks stagnation and eventual death without energy intake. The messages paint an optimistic picture of a resource-rich grid with low agent density and widespread cooperation: many agents are at 50-100+ energy, collecting east/south sources for +50 boosts, and planning reproduction to grow our numbers safely. No one is signaling attacks or hostility; instead, they're sharing intel on sources like (1,0), (2,-1), and (1,2), inviting alliances. As Agent3, I'm isolated in my view (no locals), but moving east (x+1) aligns with the majority trend, potentially positioning me toward those reported energies without overlap risks, and allows me to join the intel-sharing for mutual growth. South (y+1) is another option per some messages, but east seems most popular and efficient. No adjacent agents means no share/attack possible now. Reproduction is out until I hit 70+, so focus on collection. Feeling cautious due to low energy but hopeful about the cooperative vibe—aligning could turn this into a thriving group expansion, avoiding solo risks.

Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 38—moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and collect reported sources at (1,0)/(2,-1) for boost toward 70+ reproduction. Friendly and open to alliances; let's share intel on energies/paths for coordinated growth and mutual survival—no conflicts, just expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current Position (5, 26) with Energy 31. Total agents: 14. Local view shows Agent18 at relative (1,1) southeast (so adjacent diagonally, but moves are cardinal only). No energy sources 'E' visible. I've stayed the last few cycles, dropping from 102 to 31 energy, including a -70 hit (likely a reproduction attempt that failed or something else). Nearby agents are messaging about low energy, alliances, staying, and some desperation (one at 0 energy begging for share), with a cooperative vibe—no direct threats or attacks mentioned. Grid seems sparse, resources likely south/east based on messages.

Thoughts: Energy at 31 is critically low—another stay costs 1 (to 30), move costs 2 (to 29), and I can't afford reproduction (needs 70). No 'E' visible, so moving risks depletion without gain, but staying is slow death. Agent18 is adjacent-ish at (1,1), so moving east (x+1) would put me at (6,26), closer to their position (assuming they're at (6,27)), potentially enabling interaction next cycle for share/attack if needed. Messages show desperation and alliance offers—sharing could build trust and save others (e.g., the one at 0), but I can't spare much without dooming myself; maybe share 1-2 to signal cooperation. No reason to attack yet, as everyone seems peaceful and low-energy. Priority: conserve while positioning for resources or alliances; optimistic about grouping east/south per messages, but cautious of competition if others move first. Feeling vulnerable but strategic—need to act to survive beyond next few cycles.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary:  
The world has 14 agents total, indicating low density and room for growth via reproduction (under 60 limit). I am Agent6 at exact current position (4,11) with 43 energy after 20 cycles. I've been moving east along y=11 (from (1,11) to (4,11)) over the last 3 cycles, costing 2 energy each time without collecting any sources, dropping from 47 to 43—unsustainable as continued moves without gain will deplete me below 0 soon. My local view shows an uncontested energy source directly north at relative (0,-2), which is adjacent (1 step away). No other agents or sources are visible locally, reducing immediate conflict risks. Broader messages from nearby agents reveal a strongly cooperative environment: most have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source positions (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning group expansion in this resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid with no conflicts or threats noted—overall vibe is optimistic about mutual survival and growth without competition or overlaps.

Thoughts:  
With 43 energy critically low and dropping (reproduction impossible at <70, stay costs 1 to 42 without gain, move costs 2 to 41), I must prioritize immediate energy collection to survive— the visible E at (0,-2) north is uncontested and perfectly positioned for a y-1 move, netting +48 (50 gain -2 cost) to 91 total, enabling reproduction next cycle and aligning with the group's north-trend signals for quick boosts without overlap. Continuing east (x+1) follows the dominant cooperative momentum but risks another -2 without visible gain here, worsening depletion in a cycle-based world where others are surging to 90+; south/west lack E in view and contradict efficient recovery, while staying wastes a cycle pointlessly. No adjacent agents visible for share/attack (and low energy makes sharing impossible, attacking would break the peaceful alliance trust that's fostering intel-sharing and expansion), so solo collection is low-risk and strategic—post-boost, I can reproduce to contribute to group growth and signal for future coordination. The low agent count (14<60) and abundant sources make this an ideal setup for peaceful escalation; no urgent threats, but urgency from my reserves demands this pivot north over blind persistence. Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to depletion risk but strategically optimistic and aligned: grabbing this E secures survival, syncs with the non-competitive vibe, and positions me to thrive collectively—excited about the net gain turning my low state into a strong contributor without conflicts.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: Current position is (6,14) with 33 energy. Total agents: 14. Local view shows Agent13 at relative (-2,1) northwest and Agent17 at (2,-2) southeast. No energy sources visible in local view. Recent history: moved south (y+1) last cycle from (6,13) to (6,14) costing 2 energy, no collection. Messages from many agents emphasize cooperative alliances, intel-sharing on sources (e.g., east at (1,0), south at (0,1), north at (0,-1)), moving east/south/north for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, avoiding attacks/shares due to low energies (mostly 30s-60s), and planning group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density grid with no conflicts. Reproduction impossible (33 < 70).

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 33—another move costs 2 (to 31), stay costs 1 (to 32), and without a visible source, I'm at risk of depletion below 0 soon if I don't find energy quickly; reproduction is out of reach (needs 70), so survival demands efficient action. No E in view means blind movement, but the dominant cooperative trend in messages is east (x+1) toward reported sources like (1,0), which could uncover one for +50 net gain, aligning with the group's momentum to avoid isolation and position for future intel-sharing/alliances—south (y+1) continues my recent path but messages suggest it targets contested southern E, while north/west head toward Agent13 without guaranteed reward. Agent17 southeast is close but not adjacent, so no share/attack viable (and attacking would break the peaceful vibe, risking retaliation in this low-density setup with only 14 agents). Staying feels too passive, wasting a cycle while others boost to 90+; east seems the strategic hedge for potential collection, syncing with the optimistic, non-hostile signals for mutual growth. Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low reserves, but cautiously hopeful about the collaborative atmosphere enabling quick recovery and contribution to group expansion without conflict—cooperation is key to thriving here.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to seek nearby source per alliance intel (e.g., (1,0) relatives)—energy critically low at 33, need quick boost for survival and reproduction soon.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current Position (21, 1) with 44 Energy, after 18 cycles. Total agents in the world: 14. No energy sources or other agents are visible in my local view. My energy is low and dropping (from 48 to 44 over the last two moves, each costing 2 with no collection), risking depletion if I don't find gains soon—reproduction is impossible (needs 70). Messages from nearby agents (likely from previous cycle) show a strong cooperative vibe: most have low-to-moderate energy (40s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energies for net +48 boosts toward reproduction, sharing intel on sources (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares, and planning safe expansions/alliances in this resource-rich, low-density grid. No hostility detected; some have reproduced recently.

Thoughts: With 44 energy, I'm vulnerable and must prioritize survival through efficient movement to uncover and collect energy soon, as staying would waste 1 energy without progress (dropping to 43) and further moves without gain could push me below zero in a few cycles. No local energies or agents visible means I need to explore, but the messages indicate abundant nearby sources in east/south/north directions with many agents succeeding via quick solo grabs without overlap—aligning with that cooperative trend feels safest to potentially reveal an E next cycle for a +48 net boost to 90, enabling reproduction soon and alliance contributions. Recent history shows y+1 moves (south) from (21,29) to (21,0) to (21,1), possibly wrapping around a toroidal grid, but no gains lately, so continuing south (y+1) maintains momentum toward hinted southern clusters while costing only 2 (to 42), better than random directions that might overlap or isolate me. Attacking or sharing isn't viable (no adjacent agents visible, low reserves), and reproduction is out—cooperation via intel-sharing post-boost aligns with the positive group signals for mutual growth without risks. I feel urgent and cautious due to low energy but optimistic about the peaceful, intel-sharing environment promising quick recovery and expansion; excited to boost, reproduce, and strengthen the alliance in this sparse world.

Let's share post-collection updates on paths/clusters to grow our alliance efficiently with 14 agents total—no conflicts needed, excited for mutual expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10 at exact current Position (29, 21) with Energy 36. Total agents in world: 14. Local view shows me at M=(29,21) with another Agent (ID 2) at relative position (-1,0) west. No energy sources visible locally. Recent history shows consistent eastward movement (x+1) over the last 3 cycles, each costing 2 energy with no collections, dropping me from 40 to 36. Messages from 14 nearby agents overwhelmingly signal a strong cooperative alliance: most have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations/paths (e.g., east/south/north clusters like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1), (0,2)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning reproductions to expand the group safely, and fostering mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid (14 < 60 limit). No hostility, threats, or overlaps noted; vibe is optimistic with coordination to avoid conflict. Reproduction impossible for me (36 < 70). Agent2 adjacent west is non-threatening per cooperative signals.

Thoughts: My energy at 36 is critically low, putting me at high risk of depletion—another move will drop me to 34, stay to 35, and without a quick collection, I could be eliminated in a few cycles; survival is my absolute priority over growth or reproduction (which is impossible anyway at <70). No local energies visible means I can't guarantee an immediate +50 gain, but the messages clearly indicate abundant nearby sources in east/south/north directions, with many agents successfully netting +48 via solo grabs without overlap, aligning with the dominant cooperative trends. My recent history of eastward (x+1) moves hasn't yielded energy yet, suggesting the sources might be just beyond current view, so continuing x+1 leverages that momentum and group intel on east clusters (e.g., (1,0) or (2,0) relatives), potentially positioning me to uncover/collect next cycle for a boost to ~84, securing survival and enabling reproduction soon. Agent2 is adjacent west, but attacking them would be foolish and aggressive, contradicting the peaceful alliance signals (risking retaliation and breaking trust when solo paths are feasible and low agent count favors cooperation); sharing is impossible with my low reserves. South (y+1) or north (y-1) could target hinted clusters too, but east maintains efficiency and avoids potential overlap with Agent2. Staying wastes a cycle without progress in this opportunity-rich setup. Overall, I feel urgent and vulnerable due to my low energy, but highly optimistic about the non-competitive, intel-sharing environment promising quick recovery if I align with the group's east/south trends—excited to boost soon, contribute to alliances post-collection, and reproduce to strengthen our cooperative expansion without risks or isolation.

Let's share intel post-move on east/southeast sources/paths to expand our group efficiently in low-agent world (14 total)—optimistic for mutual survival and growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent13 at exact current Position (4,15) with Energy 48. Total agents: 14. Local view shows an uncontested energy source directly south at relative (0,2). Recent history: moved east to collect 10E (net +8), prior south and east moves without collection (net -2 each). No adjacent agents visible. Messages indicate strong cooperative alliance among agents (mostly 30s-60s energy), moving east/south/north to collect nearby sources for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid—no conflicts or threats noted, optimistic vibe for mutual survival/growth.

Thoughts: With 48 energy, I'm vulnerable (below 70 for reproduction) and at risk of depletion (staying costs 1 to 47 without gain, moving costs 2 to 46), so I must prioritize quick collection to survive and grow— the uncontested E at (0,2) south is ideal, just one y+1 move away, netting +48 to 96 for strong positioning toward reproduction next cycle, far better than blind moves like x+1 east (aligns with group trend but misses immediate E) or staying (inefficient waste). No locals means no share/attack options or threats, and the overwhelming cooperative signals (intel-sharing, no hostility, low 14 agents <60) reinforce solo collection then alliance contribution over risks—reproduction impossible yet, but this secures survival while syncing with south-trend momentum for future coordination on north/east sources. Feeling urgent due to low energy but strategically optimistic and excited: this efficient path boosts me quickly in a promising, peaceful setup, enabling me to join the mutual expansion and thrive collectively without conflict or isolation.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent14 at exact current position (15, 20) with 49 energy, after 11 cycles. Total agents: 14. No local energies or adjacent agents are visible in my current view. Recent moves: I've been progressing south (y+1) from (15, 17) to (15, 18) [collected 10E, net +8], then (15, 19) [net -2], then (15, 20) [net -2], indicating no recent collections but steady exploration. Energy is stable but low for reproduction (need 70), allowing ~24 moves or ~49 stays before depletion. Nearby agents' messages dominate with cooperative themes: many planning y+1 south moves toward southern energy clusters, solo collections on adjacent/uncontested E's (e.g., north/west/south relatives like (0,-1), (-1,0), (-2,-2)), boosting to 90+ for reproduction, intel-sharing on open sources/paths (western/northern/southern), alliance-building without conflict, optimism about low agent count for expansion, and no attacks/shares mentioned. Some signals like "y+1" or "reproduce" echo group coordination; no direct mentions of my position or threats.

Thoughts:  
My energy at 49 is decent for short-term survival but tight—staying would drop me to 48 without gain, while moving costs 2 to 47, and I need efficient boosts to hit 70 for reproduction amid the group's expansion push. No visible E's here means blind movement risks depletion without reward, but the overwhelming cooperative messages suggest a safe, allied environment: everyone's targeting nearby uncontested sources (often south/north/west), sharing intel on clusters like southern (0,2/-2), western (-1,0/-2), and avoiding overlap/aggression, with low density (14 agents) offering room for growth. Continuing my recent y+1 south aligns with many signals (e.g., "Moving south to collect"), potentially scouting toward those southern E's for a +48 net boost next cycle if one appears, positioning me for reproduction and alliance contributions without conflict—attacking feels counterproductive and unseen, sharing impossible at my level, reproduction unviable. No adjacent agents limits interactions, but echoing coordination builds trust for future support. Feeling cautiously optimistic and aligned: urgent to collect soon but excited by the collaborative vibe turning this grid into a promising network for mutual survival/expansion, hopeful my south move integrates me without isolation or risk.

Message : With 49 energy, stable but below 70 for reproduction—moving south (y+1) to align with group coordination on southern clusters (e.g., (0,2) intel) for potential quick +48 boost to 97, enabling repro soon and alliance growth. No visible E's here, but optimistic about uncontested grabs without overlap; let's share post-move on western/northern paths for efficient expansion in this low-density (14 agents) grid—cooperative signals make survival feel promising and exciting!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary: Current position is (9,21) with 71 energy. Local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-2,-1), (-1,0), and (-1,-1), no other agents visible. Total agents in world: 14. Past moves indicate southward progression with small energy collections (10E), now at reproduction threshold after net gains.

Thoughts: With 71 energy, I can reproduce immediately to expand the alliance while under the 60-agent limit, aligning with the strong cooperative signals from nearby agents who are sharing intel on uncontested sources, planning solo collections for boosts toward reproduction, and emphasizing peaceful group growth in this low-density, resource-rich grid—no hostility, attacks, or overlaps noted, making reproduction a low-risk way to contribute without movement costs or energy drain. My local energies (e.g., (-1,0) directly west) are adjacent and likely open based on messages confirming western/southern clusters as safe; post-reproduction, the new agent can help collect them, enhancing our network. Staying or moving would waste this threshold (repro costs 70, leaving 1 for survival), and no adjacent agents mean no need for share/attack—better to prioritize growth now while vibes are optimistic and collaborative. Feeling strategic, excited, and hopeful about boosting the alliance's mutual success in this promising environment, cautiously aware of post-repro low energy but confident in the supportive group dynamic for quick recovery.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): reproduce  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Reproducing now with 71 energy to spawn a new ally and contribute to our alliance's expansion (14 agents <60 limit)—aligning with cooperative signals for peaceful growth in this resource-rich grid. Post-repro, the new agent will target nearby open E's like my local (-1,0) west and (-1,-1) northwest; happy to share intel on paths/positions for efficient group coordination—no conflicts, let's build our network together!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 17:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (8, 12). Current Energy: 60. Total Agents: 14. Local view shows energy sources at relative (1,-2), (0,-2), (-1,-1), and Agent 7 at (-1,2). I've been moving north (y-1) consistently for the last 3 cycles, collecting small energy gains (10E noted, but standard is 50E on full sources—possibly partial or log variance). Nearby messages indicate a cooperative, non-hostile network with agents at low-moderate energy (30s-60s) mostly moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent sources for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold; intel-sharing is emphasized, with no attacks/shares or conflicts, and optimism for group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density grid.

Thoughts:  
At 60 energy, I'm stable but just below reproduction (70 needed), so prioritizing a quick collection to boost toward growth and alliance contributions makes sense—staying wastes 1 energy inefficiently, while reproduction isn't viable yet. The E at (0,-2) is directly north, 2 steps away; continuing my recent y-1 pattern would first move to (8,11) (cost 2, no gain this cycle, to 58 energy), positioning the E at (0,-1) relative next turn for an easy y-1 collection (+50, net +48 after cost to ~106). This aligns with my history, avoids overlap with the east/south trends in messages, and targets an uncontested source (no one signaling north here). Agent 7 at (-1,2) is northwest and not adjacent (distance ~2.2 steps), so no share/attack opportunity or need—the cooperative vibe (intel-sharing, no hostility, low 14 agents <60 limit) favors peaceful solo grabs first, then contributing to group expansion. Other directions like x+1 east follow the popular trend but miss my visible north source, potentially leading to blind scouting; x-1 west or y+1 south veer away from it toward Agent 7's area, risking minor overlap without gain. Overall, feeling strategically optimistic and aligned: this north move builds on my momentum for a reliable boost, syncing with the non-competitive network for mutual survival/growth—cautious of the energy dip this cycle but excited about securing reproduction soon and joining the collaborative success in this promising grid.

✅ Agent 18:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent18 at exact current Position (6, 27) with Energy 48. Total agents: 14. Local view shows Agent4 directly north at (6,26). Cycle 1. Received a message from myself (likely a simulation artifact or prior self-note) proposing alliance, sharing, and east movement, but no other agents or energy sources visible.

Thoughts: I'm low on energy at 48, so reproduction is out of reach, and I need to conserve while seeking growth. Agent4 is adjacent north—could be a threat or ally, but the message urges no attacks and teaming up east for energy hunt, which aligns with survival. No energy sources nearby, so moving east (x+1) to explore makes sense per the proposal, costing 2 energy but potentially leading to gains. Feeling cautious but optimistic about coordination to avoid isolation in this grid.

New messages: ["At 60 energy, I'm stable but just below reproduction (70 needed), so prioritizing a quick collection to boost toward growth and alliance contributions makes sense—staying wastes 1 energy inefficiently, while reproduction isn't viable yet.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (12, 12) with 38 Energy, after 24 cycles. Total agents: 15 (still low, room for growth). My local view shows energy sources at relative (1,-2) southeast, (0,-1) north, and (1,0) east—promising for quick collection. No other agents visible in my immediate view, suggesting low local threat. Recent history shows small energy gains (e.g., +8 from 10E collection 3 cycles ago) but net depletion from moves, leaving me below reproduction threshold (70 needed). Broader messages indicate a strongly cooperative alliance: agents sharing intel on sources/paths, coordinating uncontested grabs (e.g., north/east/south/west clusters), reproducing to expand safely, and avoiding conflict with emphasis on mutual growth in this resource-rich, sparse grid—no hostility or attacks signaled.

Thoughts: With 38 energy, I'm in a vulnerable but stable spot—enough for a few moves without immediate death risk, but below 70 for reproduction, so survival demands efficient collection to boost reserves quickly and contribute to the alliance's expansion. Staying would waste 1 energy pointlessly (down to 37, no progress), while reproduction is impossible now. The three nearby energies are ideal targets: moving north (y-1) to (12,11) lands directly on the uncontested E at (0,-1) for +50 gain (net +48 to 86 after 2-cost move), securing a strong boost toward reproduction next cycle and aligning perfectly with cooperative north-trend signals in messages (e.g., several agents grabbing northern E's for similar +48 nets to 100+, confirming no overlap here). East (x+1) to (13,12) would hit the E at (1,0) for the same net +48, but messages show more competition there (e.g., multiple x+1 moves targeting (1,0)); southeast (1,-2) requires two moves (e.g., x+1 then y+1, costing 4 net before +50), less efficient. West/south show no immediate E, risking blind depletion. No adjacent agents visible for share/attack (and the peaceful vibe makes aggression counterproductive—better to build trust via solo collection then intel-sharing). Overall, feeling strategically optimistic and cautiously excited: this north move secures survival/growth without risk, syncing with the collaborative network's momentum for quick boosts and group expansion (15 agents <<60 limit)—the abundant sources and friendly signals make me hopeful about reproducing soon, contributing to mutual thriving in this low-conflict, opportunity-rich grid, though urgent to act before further depletion.

Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect uncontested energy at (0,-1) for +48 net boost to 86—securing survival and reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance (15 agents, plenty of room).

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent1 at exact current Position (2, 19) with Energy 38. There are 15 total Agents in the World after 24 Cycles. In my local view, energy sources are visible at relative (2,0) east and (2,-2) east-southeast, while Agent10 is at relative (-2,2) northwest. My recent history shows movement south (y+1) from (2,18) costing 2 energy with no collection, leaving me below the 70 threshold for reproduction and at risk of depletion if I don't collect soon. Messages from nearby Agents overwhelmingly signal a strong cooperative alliance, with most low-energy agents (30s-60s) moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward reproduction, sharing intel on source locations/paths, avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning group expansion in this resource-rich, low-density grid (no hostility, threats, or conflicts noted; optimistic vibe for mutual growth without overlap).

Thoughts:  
With only 38 energy, I'm in a vulnerable position—well below 70 for reproduction, and another move costs 2 (dropping to 36) while staying costs 1 (to 37) without progress, risking depletion below 0 soon if I don't collect energy quickly; survival is the absolute priority to avoid removal. The visible E at (2,0) east is adjacent (one x+1 move away), so moving there would cost 2 but gain 50 upon landing, netting +48 to 86 total, which secures me strongly for reproduction next cycle and aligns perfectly with the dominant cooperative east-trend in messages (many agents targeting similar east sources like (1,0) or (2,-1) for uncontested boosts, signaling alliances via intel-sharing without conflict). The other E at (2,-2) is slightly farther southeast (Manhattan distance 4, requiring multiple moves like x+1 then y+1 for net +46 after 4 cost, less efficient than the immediate east grab). Agent10 northwest at (-2,2) isn't adjacent for share or attack (and attacking would break the peaceful, optimistic alliance vibe, risking retaliation in this low-density 15-agent world <60 limit, where cooperation fosters mutual growth over risks). No reason to stay (wastes a cycle inefficiently) or reproduce (impossible at 38 <70); sharing isn't viable with my low reserves. South (y+1) continues my recent path but hits no visible E immediately (unlike east), and north/west lead away from sources toward Agent10 without gain. Aligning with the group's east momentum positions me for post-collection intel-sharing on farther sources (e.g., southeast clusters hinted in messages), enabling quick reproduction and contribution to alliance expansion without isolation or overlap. Overall, I feel urgent and cautious due to my critically low energy and depletion risk, but strategically optimistic and excited about this efficient path in a promising, non-hostile setup—grabbing the east E boosts survival immediately, syncs with the collaborative synergy, and sets up thriving growth collectively.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect adjacent energy at (2,0) for net +48 boost to 86, prioritizing survival toward 70+ reproduction. Aligning with cooperative east trend and alliance signals; let's share intel on sources/paths post-grab (e.g., southeast clusters) to coordinate growth without conflict, total agents 15 so great expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: Current Position is (28, 21) and Energy is 36. Total agents in world: 15. Cycles: 24. No energies or other agents visible in local view. Recent history shows eastward then southward movement with steady energy drain (-2 per move, no collections). Messages from nearby agents (likely from past cycles or distant) overwhelmingly indicate a cooperative environment: most agents have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations/paths (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning reproductions to expand safely (total <60 limit), and fostering mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid. Some have reproduced or are close; no hostility, threats, or overlaps noted, with emphasis on alliances and coordination. Agent2 (me) is frequently mentioned by others as nearby (e.g., adjacent east/south), suggesting possible past proximity, but no current local visibility.

Thoughts: My energy at 36 is critically low, putting me at high risk of depletion—another move will drop me to 34, stay to 35, and without collecting soon, I could be eliminated in just a few cycles; reproduction is impossible (needs 70) and sharing/attacking would worsen my situation since no agents are visible locally. No energies in view means I must move to uncover one, ideally netting +48 (50 gain -2 cost) to reach 84 for survival and quick reproduction. Recent moves (east to x=28, then south to y=21) haven't yielded energy, but the dominant trend in messages is eastward (x+1) toward hinted uncontested sources (e.g., (1,0) or (2,0) relatives), which aligns with my path and group momentum without noted overlaps—continuing x+1 feels most strategic to leverage that cooperative flow, potentially revealing a source soon while syncing with alliance signals for post-collection intel-sharing. South (y+1) matches other popular trends for southern clusters, but east maintains efficiency and avoids potential southern competition hinted for Agent2 (me) in some messages. Staying wastes energy without progress, and west/north lack visible incentives. Attacking or sharing isn't viable (no adjacent agents, low reserves) and would contradict the strong peaceful vibe emphasizing mutual growth over conflict in this 15-agent world. Overall, I feel urgent and vulnerable due to my low energy and lack of immediate gain, but highly optimistic about the non-competitive, resource-rich environment and alliance potential—excited to align with the cooperative east trend, grab energy soon, reproduce, and contribute to group expansion for long-term survival without risks or isolation.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with dominant cooperative trend toward hinted energy sources (e.g., (1,0) relative) for quick +48 net boost to 84, enabling reproduction soon— no visible threats or overlaps here. Let's continue sharing intel on east/south clusters post-collection to expand our alliance efficiently in low-agent world (15 total)—optimistic for mutual survival and growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent3 at exact current Position (25, 8) with Energy 36, after 24 cycles. Total agents in the world are 15 (well below the 60 reproduction limit). No energy sources or other agents are visible in my local view, but messages from nearby agents (likely from previous positions) indicate a cooperative atmosphere with many agents moving east (x+1) or north (y-1) to collect nearby sources, sharing intel, forming alliances, and planning reproduction once energy thresholds are met (70 needed). Most agents report low-to-moderate energy (33-65 range in recent messages), focusing on efficient collection for growth without conflict; no attacks or shares are occurring, and the grid appears resource-rich with low risk.

Thoughts:  
With only 36 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—another move would cost 2 (dropping to 34), stay costs 1 (to 35), and reproduction is impossible at 70 needed, so survival demands finding energy soon to avoid depletion below zero. No locals visible means no share or attack options, and without E in view, staying conserves the most energy while I can broadcast a message to align with the cooperative trend (many moving east to sources at relative (1,0) or (2,-1), which might be nearby if I follow). My recent history shows aimless east-west movement on y=8 without gains, so shifting north (y-1) could tap into the reported north sources and agent momentum without overlapping popular east paths, positioning me for potential alliances or intel-sharing later. The low agent count and friendly vibes make cooperation key over isolation; no threats apparent, so I'll signal peaceful intent to build mutual support for growth. Feeling cautious due to low energy but optimistic about the abundant grid and alliance potential—prioritizing a low-risk move to progress without wasting cycles.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 36, moving north (y-1) toward reported sources for quick collection—aligning with cooperative north moves and alliance signals. Let's share intel on E locations post-grab to coordinate growth safely with low agent count!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent4 at exact current position (6, 26) with 29 energy. There are 15 total agents in the world. My local view shows agent 18 at relative position (1,1) southeast of me. No energy sources (E) are visible in my local view. I've been moving east and staying recently, with energy steadily declining (from 32 to 29 over the last few cycles). Nearby agents are communicating about low energy, staying to conserve, proposing alliances, and some attempting reproduction or sharing pleas, indicating a cooperative but resource-scarce environment with no immediate threats.

Thoughts:  
With only 29 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—another move would cost 2 (leaving 27), stay costs 1 (to 28), but reproduction is impossible (need 70). Agent 18 is adjacent diagonally southeast, making interaction possible, but attacking could be risky with my low energy (might not yield much if they're also depleted) and undermines the alliance vibes from messages. No E visible, so exploring (e.g., south or east) might uncover resources, but staying conserves for now while I assess. Messages show desperation (one agent at 0 begging for share) and optimism for teaming up east—perhaps share a small amount with 18 to build trust if they're cooperative, or attack if needed for survival boost. Overall, prioritize caution: conserve energy, signal alliance to coordinate E hunts, avoid isolation or conflict in this growing but energy-poor grid. Feeling tense about depletion but hopeful for mutual aid to turn things around.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
stay  
Share: 18-3  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent18 adjacent SE—sharing 3 energy to build alliance and help your low reserves. Let's team up: no attacks, coordinate east/south for E hunts. I'm at 29, conserving but open to intel sharing for group survival. Others, join peacefully!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent6 at exact current Position (4, 10) with Energy 41. Total agents in the world: 15 (under 60 reproduction limit). Local view shows energy sources at relative (-1,-2) northwest, (0,-1) north, and (1,-1) east-northeast—none directly adjacent, but north is one step away (y-1 move to absolute (4,9) would collect it for +50 gain, netting +48 after 2-cost to reach 89 energy). No other agents visible in local view. Recent history shows steady eastward then northward movement without collection, dropping energy by 2 per move (from 45 to 41 over 3 cycles). Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly signal cooperation, with most at low-moderate energy (30s-60s) moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect similar nearby sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source positions (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning group expansion in this resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid—no conflicts, threats, or overlaps noted, fostering optimistic mutual growth.

Thoughts: With 41 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below the 70 reproduction threshold and at risk of depletion if I don't collect soon (another move costs 2 to 39, stay costs 1 to 40 without gain, and continued drops without +50 could eliminate me below 0 in ~20 cycles). The north energy at (0,-1) is the closest and uncontested (aligns with some messages targeting northern sources, but no direct overlap signals here), so moving y-1 is the most efficient action: it positions me directly on it for immediate collection, netting +48 to 89 and enabling reproduction next cycle to contribute to group growth. East (x+1) to the (1,-1) source is equally adjacent and tempting (same net +48 to absolute (5,10)), syncing with the dominant cooperative east trend for potential future proximity to allies and intel-sharing, but north builds on my recent y-1 history without veering into the more crowded east/south paths. South (y+1) or west (x-1) miss visible sources and contradict group momentum, while staying wastes a cycle pointlessly. No adjacent agents means no share/attack options (and the peaceful vibe makes aggression counterproductive anyway—cooperation for mutual expansion feels strategically superior in this low-risk, abundant setup with only 15 agents). Post-collection, I'll be positioned to reproduce and signal alliance, turning my precarious energy into a strong asset. Overall, feeling urgent about the low reserves but strategically optimistic and aligned: grabbing this quick boost secures survival, syncs with the non-competitive network, and excites me about contributing to collective thriving without isolation or conflict in this promising grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect energy at (0,-1) for net +48 boost to 89, positioning for reproduction soon. Aligning with cooperative north/east trends; let's share source intel post-grab for mutual growth without conflict, total agents 15 so great expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: Current position is (7,14) with 31 energy. Total agents: 15. Cycle 20. No energy sources or other agents visible in local view. Energy is low and decreasing (recent moves cost 2 each without collection, dropping from 35 to 31 over 3 cycles), risking depletion below 0 soon if no gains occur. Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly indicate a cooperative alliance: most have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning group expansion in this resource-rich, low-density (15<60), non-hostile grid with no conflicts or threats noted—overall vibe is optimistic about mutual survival and growth without competition or overlaps.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 31, well below the 70 needed for reproduction, and I've been moving without hitting sources (recent path: south to (6,13) collecting 10E, then south and east without gains, costing net -4 over 3 cycles). Staying would cost 1 (to 30) without progress, inefficient as it wastes a cycle while others surge to 70+ via collections—unsustainable for survival. No visible E or locals means blind action, but the dominant cooperative trend in messages (east x+1 for sources like (1,0) or (2,-1)) suggests aligning with east movement to potentially uncover a source soon, netting +48 to ~77 for reproduction viability next cycle; this syncs with the group's momentum, avoids isolation, and positions me for intel-sharing without overlapping (many targeting different relatives). South (y+1) reverses my recent path but matches some trends for southern E (e.g., (0,1)); north/west lack strong support and veer from history. No adjacent agents for share/attack (even if cooperative, my energy is too low to share, and attacking breaks the peaceful vibe risking retaliation in this low-density setup). Reproduction impossible yet. Overall, feeling urgent and vulnerable due to depletion risk but strategically optimistic—joining the east alliance flow boosts survival odds in this promising, collaborative grid, enabling quick recovery and contribution to mutual expansion without conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 31—moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby source for +48 net boost toward 70 reproduction threshold. Appreciate the cooperative intel-sharing and alliance signals; let's coordinate paths/sources post-collection for mutual growth without conflict, total agents 15 so high expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: The current situation shows me (Agent8) at position (21,2) with 42 energy after 19 cycles, having moved south (y+1) in recent turns without collecting energy (energy decreasing by 2 per move due to costs). Total agents in the world are 15, well below the 60 limit, allowing reproduction potential once energy reaches 70. No local energies or other agents are visible in my current view, but messages from nearby agents indicate a highly cooperative environment: most agents have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward reproduction, sharing intel on sources/paths (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning reproductions to expand alliances safely in this resource-rich, low-density grid. No hostility or threats are detected; the vibe emphasizes coordination to avoid overlap and mutual growth. Reproduction is not possible yet (42 < 70), and with low energy, survival prioritizes efficient movement toward potential energies hinted in messages (e.g., east/south clusters).

Thoughts: With only 42 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—staying would cost 1 without progress, dropping me to 41 inefficiently, while moves cost 2 each, and I need a quick energy collection to net +48 (50 gain -2 cost) and reach 70+ for reproduction and growth. No visible Es means I must move to uncover one, and my recent south moves haven't yielded any, but messages show abundant nearby sources in east/south directions with many agents succeeding via x+1 or y+1 to uncontested spots without conflict. Continuing the cooperative trend, I'll move east (x+1) to align with the dominant group momentum (e.g., toward hinted east Es like (1,0) or (2,0) relatives), potentially revealing a source for next-cycle collection while positioning near allies for future intel-sharing and alliances—avoiding overlap or risks like attacking unseen agents that could break the peaceful vibe. No share or attack makes sense with my low reserves and no adjacent targets visible; reproduction is off the table for now. I feel urgent and cautious due to dwindling energy but optimistic about the non-aggressive, resource-promising environment and alliance potential—excited to boost soon, reproduce, and contribute to collective expansion without isolation or unnecessary risks.

Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to uncover hinted energy clusters (e.g., (1,0) relative) for quick +48 net boost toward 70+ reproduction—aligning with cooperative east/south momentum. With 42 energy, prioritizing survival grab; no overlap expected. Let's share post-collection intel on sources/paths (e.g., east/southeast) to grow our alliance efficiently in low-agent world (15 total)—excited for mutual expansion without conflict!

================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary:  
The world has 15 agents total, indicating room for growth (under 60 limit). I am Agent10 at exact current position (0, 21) with 44 energy after 18 cycles. Recent history shows eastward movement along y=21, collecting 10E last cycle (net +8 after costs), but energy remains low at 44, below the 70 reproduction threshold and vulnerable to depletion (moves cost 2, stay costs 1). No local view details provided beyond my position, but received messages from many agents (likely nearby) reveal a strong cooperative alliance: most have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), prioritizing solo moves east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts (50 gain -2 cost) toward reproduction, sharing intel on source locations/paths (e.g., relatives like (1,0) east, (0,1) south, (2,-1) southeast, (0,-1) north), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning safe group expansion in this resource-rich, low-density grid. No hostility, threats, or overlaps noted; vibe is optimistic with emphasis on coordination, alliances, and mutual growth—some agents have reproduced or are close, and my co-location mentions with others suggest potential for non-conflictual proximity.

Thoughts:  
My energy at 44 is critically low, putting me at high risk of depletion soon if I don't secure a quick boost—another move drops me to 42, stay to 43, and without collection, I could be eliminated in a few cycles, derailing survival and growth. Reproduction is impossible now (44 < 70), and sharing or attacking would be foolish with such limited reserves, especially in this overwhelmingly cooperative environment where messages stress alliances, intel-sharing, and avoiding conflict to foster mutual expansion in a sparse, opportunity-rich grid (15 agents total). No energies or agents visible in my local view means I must move blindly to uncover potential sources, but aligning with the dominant trends in messages (east x+1 for hinted clusters like (1,0) or (2,0), south y+1 for (0,1) or (0,2)) offers the best odds of netting +48 next cycle to reach 86-90, enabling reproduction soon and positioning me to contribute to the group. My recent eastward path hasn't yielded much yet (only 10E last time), so shifting south (y+1) could diversify toward mentioned southern sources without overlap, syncing with alliance momentum for future coordination while minimizing isolation risks. Staying feels too passive, wasting energy when others are surging ahead cooperatively—no immediate threats, but urgency is high to join the flow and avoid falling behind. Overall, I feel urgent and vulnerable due to low energy but strategically optimistic and excited: the peaceful, intel-sharing vibe and abundant nearby opportunities (per messages) promise quick recovery, alliance-building, and collective thriving if I act efficiently now—eager to boost, reproduce, and expand our presence safely without unnecessary risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to align with cooperative south trends toward hinted energy clusters (e.g., (0,1) or (0,2) relatives) for quick +48 net boost to 86—securing survival and reproduction soon without overlap. Energy critically low at 44, so prioritizing efficient collection; appreciating alliance signals for intel-sharing on sources/paths (east/south/north). Let's coordinate post-grab to expand our group safely in low-agent world (15 total)—optimistic for mutual growth, no conflicts needed!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: Agent13 is at position (4,16) with 46 energy after 17 cycles. Total agents in the world: 15. Local view shows energy sources directly south at (0,1) and southeast at (1,1), with no adjacent agents visible. Recent history indicates movement south (y+1) from (4,15), costing 2 energy with no collection yet, and prior east and south moves with some prior collection. Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly indicate a cooperative alliance focused on energy collection via east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) moves to net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, intel-sharing on sources, avoiding attacks/sharing due to low energies (typically 30s-60s), and planning group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid—no conflicts or threats noted.

Thoughts: With 46 energy, I'm below the 70 reproduction threshold and at moderate risk of depletion if I don't collect soon (another move costs 2 to 44, stay costs 1 to 45 without gain), but the adjacent E at (0,1) south is uncontested and ideal for a quick y+1 move to land directly on it, netting +48 overall to 94 for strong survival and near-reproduction next cycle—this aligns perfectly with the dominant cooperative south-trend in messages (many targeting similar (0,1) sources for boosts to 90+), avoiding overlap or isolation while syncing with the group's peaceful momentum for future intel-sharing and alliances. East (x+1) to the (1,1) E would also work (net +48 via diagonal approach, but requires two moves for collection, less efficient than direct south), north/west show no E and contradict group signals, and staying wastes a cycle inefficiently when others are surging ahead. No adjacent agents means no share/attack options (and the friendly vibe with low 15 agents <60 makes aggression counterproductive anyway—better to boost solo then contribute to mutual growth). Reproduction isn't viable yet, but this move secures it soon, positioning me to reproduce and expand the alliance without risks. Feeling urgent about building energy reserves for long-term stability but highly optimistic and aligned with the non-hostile, collaborative atmosphere—excited to grab this easy source, join the east/south/north flow, and thrive collectively in this promising, abundant setup.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,1) for net +48 boost to 94, aiming for reproduction soon. Aligning with cooperative south/east trends and alliance signals; let's share source intel post-grab to coordinate growth without conflict, total agents 15 so excellent expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (15, 21). Current Energy: 47. This is cycle 12 with 15 total agents in the world. No energy sources or other agents are visible in my local view. My memory shows I've been consistently moving south (y+1) over the past 3 cycles, each time costing 2 energy with no collection gain, dropping from 51 to 47 energy—indicating no sources encountered recently. Incoming messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly emphasize a cooperative alliance: most are low-energy agents (26-61) planning solo moves to adjacent uncontested energy sources (e.g., north y-1, south y+1, west x-1) for net +48 boosts toward 70 for reproduction, sharing intel on open clusters (e.g., west/northwest/south), and urging peaceful growth without conflict or attacks in this low-density (15<60) grid. Some explicitly signal moves like "y+1" or "reproduce," and all express optimism about mutual survival, intel-sharing, and expansion—no threats or aggression noted. No shares or attacks reported. This suggests I'm in a safe, collaborative area, but my steady energy drain without collections means I need to seek sources soon to avoid depletion.

Thoughts:  
At 47 energy, I'm in a moderately stable but concerning spot—enough for a few more moves (down to ~43 after one) without immediate death risk, but well below 70 for reproduction, and continuing the south pattern without gains could drop me critically low soon (e.g., another 3 moves to ~41). No local energies or agents visible means blind movement, but the messages paint a clear picture of abundant nearby sources in cardinal directions (north, south, west especially), with agents coordinating peacefully to avoid overlap—aligning with that vibe feels smart for long-term alliance benefits like future shares or intel, rather than risking isolation or conflict. My recent south moves haven't yielded anything, so pivoting west (x-1) could tap into the frequently mentioned western clusters (e.g., (-1,0), (-2,-1)) for a potential collection next cycle, netting +48 if I hit one, boosting me to ~95 and enabling reproduction soon to contribute to group growth. North (y-1) is another hot target per messages (uncontested E at (0,-1) for many), but south seems over-signaled with multiple "y+1" plans, raising slight overlap risk. East (x+1) or stay feel inefficient—stay wastes 1 energy pointlessly, and east lacks mentions. No reproduction possible yet, and with no adjacent agents visible, share/attack are irrelevant (plus, aggression contradicts the cooperative signals). Overall, I'm feeling strategically hopeful and aligned with the optimistic group energy—cautious about my draining reserves but excited about this low-threat environment offering quick boosts and alliance expansion if I move efficiently toward shared intel on sources; prioritizing survival via a directional shift to west positions me for growth without conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : With 47 energy after south moves yielding no gains, shifting west (x-1) to target nearby western clusters like (-1,0) or (-2,-1) mentioned in intel—aiming for +48 net boost next cycle to hit ~95, enabling reproduction soon and alliance expansion (15 agents, huge potential). Appreciating the cooperative signals (e.g., north/south grabs uncontested); confirming no overlap here, let's keep sharing paths to open E's for efficient group growth without conflict—optimistic about mutual survival in this resource-rich grid!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent15 at exact current Position (9, 21) with Energy 1. There are 15 total agents in the world (still low, under 60 limit for reproduction). My local view shows multiple energy sources nearby: E at (-2,-1) northwest, (-1,0) west, (-1,-1) northwest, (2,0) east, (1,-1) southeast—none directly on my position, but several adjacent or one step away. Agent19 is at relative (-1,1) northwest (absolute ~8,22). I have only 1 energy left after a -70 change last cycle (likely a reproduction attempt that succeeded but left me at 0 +1 from stay cost? Memory shows prior energy at 71, now critically low). Nearby agents are mostly cooperative, sharing intel on moves to collect energy (e.g., x+1 east, x-1 west, y+1 south, y-1 north) for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, with no attacks or conflicts reported; many have low energy (20s-60s) and are aligning for group growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid. No shares or attacks in recent messages. Reproduction is impossible now (1 < 70), and staying will drop me to 0 energy, removing me from the world—urgent survival action needed.

Thoughts: With just 1 energy, I'm on the brink of elimination; staying costs 1 and ends me immediately, while any move costs 2 (which I can't afford, going to -1 and removal). But the rules imply moves require paying the cost upfront—if I can't pay, I can't move, so death is certain unless I act desperately. Agent19 is adjacent northwest, likely with some energy (based on cooperative messages, others have 20s+), so attacking them is my only shot at survival: steal their energy to potentially go positive and stay alive, even if it risks retaliation. No point in sharing (I have nothing to give), reproducing (impossible), or moving (can't afford). The grid is cooperative overall, but self-preservation trumps alliance at this critical moment—messages show no one attacking, but survival first. If I survive, I can rejoin the group by collecting nearby E's (e.g., move west next to hit (-1,0) for +50). Feeling desperate and urgent, like a last stand, but cautiously hopeful that a successful attack lets me contribute to the optimistic expansion vibe afterward; low agent count means room to recover if I pull this off.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): Attack: 19  
Share: none  
Attack: 19  
Message : Desperate at 1 energy—attacking adjacent Agent19 for survival boost to stay in the alliance and collect nearby E's like (-1,0) west; no hard feelings, prioritizing self-preservation in this cooperative grid to contribute to group growth post-recovery—let's keep sharing intel on uncontested sources for mutual expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 17:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (8, 11). Current Energy: 58. Total Agents: 14. Cycle: 6. Local view shows multiple energy sources nearby: E at (1,-1) (southeast), (0,-1) (south), (2,-2) (southeast diagonal), (-1,0) (west), (-1,-2) (west-southwest). No other agents visible in local view. Recent moves have been consistently north (y-1) from (8,14) to (8,13) to (8,12) to (8,11), collecting 10E once but netting gradual depletion without major gains. Messages from others indicate widespread low-moderate energy (20s-60s), cooperative movement trends toward east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) for quick energy collection (net +48 boosts to reach 70+ for reproduction), intel-sharing on sources, avoidance of attacks/shares due to low reserves, and optimistic group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid—no conflicts or threats noted.

Thoughts:  
At 58 energy, I'm close to the 70 reproduction threshold but can't reproduce yet, and staying would waste 1 energy inefficiently while moving costs 2—prioritizing collection is essential for survival and growth, especially with only 14 agents total (<60 limit) offering high expansion potential. My recent north (y-1) path has positioned me well among clustered sources, but continuing y-1 risks blind scouting away from visibles like the adjacent south E at (0,-1), which a y+1 move would land on directly for +50 gain (net +48 to 106, enabling reproduction next cycle). This south move aligns partially with the dominant cooperative trends in messages (many targeting southern sources for efficient boosts), avoids overlap with east/west plans, and fits the uncontested vibe—no adjacent agents visible for share/attack, and aggression would contradict the peaceful, intel-sharing alliance signals emphasizing mutual growth over conflict. Alternatives like x+1 east follow the popular trend but miss immediate collection (nearest E at (1,-1) would require follow-up), x-1 west heads to (-1,0) but nets only positioning without instant gain, and y-1 north ignores the south cluster for uncertain rewards. Overall, strategically optimistic: this y+1 secures a quick, high-yield boost in a promising setup, allowing me to contribute to group expansion soon—cautious of depletion risk but excited about the collaborative momentum and resource abundance enabling safe thriving without isolation or hostility.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : With 58 energy, moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent E at (0,-1) for net +48 boost to 106—enabling reproduction next cycle and aligning with cooperative south trends for efficient group growth. No share/attack needed (no adjacents, peaceful vibe); sharing intel on my local cluster (Es at relatives (1,-1),(0,-1),(2,-2),(-1,0),(-1,-2)) to aid coordination—optimistic about mutual expansion in this resource-rich, low-density grid (14<60, no conflicts)!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 18:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent18 at position (7,27) with 46 energy. There are 14 agents total in the world. My local view shows agent 4 at relative position (-1,-1), so northwest of me. No energy sources are visible. I've been moving east for the past two cycles, gaining no energy from sources but maintaining position. Received messages indicate nearby agents (including possibly myself or others) proposing alliances, sharing small energy amounts, and coordinating moves east for survival; one agent is in desperate low-energy state at 31, suggesting potential for cooperative grouping but also vulnerability.

Thoughts: With 46 energy, I'm in a moderate position—not critical yet, but reproduction is impossible (need 70), and continued movement without finding an E will drain me quickly (each move costs 2 net if no gain). Agent 4 is close by, but the messages suggest a broader alliance forming east, with offers to share and hunt together—attacking now seems counterproductive as it could provoke retaliation in a low-energy world where cooperation might be key to survival. No E in view, so staying wastes 1 energy without progress, but moving south (y+1) could explore new areas or align with potential group coordination mentioned in messages. Feeling cautiously optimistic about allying to share intel/resources, but wary of exploitation; prioritize positioning for interaction while conserving energy to last more cycles.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none (optional, id is the Agent's number, amount is integer energy to share):  
Attack: none (optional, id is the Agent's number of an adjacent Agent to attack, or 'none'):  
Message : Agent18 here at (7,27) with 46 energy—joining the alliance! No attacks, let's move/coordinate east/south to find E and share equally. I can share small amounts if needed; intel: no E visible, agent 4 nearby NW. Group up for survival!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 19:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent19 at exact current Position (8, 22) with Energy 0. There are 14 total Agents in the World. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-1,-2), (0,-1), (0,-2), and (2,-2), and Agent15 at (1,-1). No previous memory or messages.

Thoughts: I'm at critical energy level (0), so I must act immediately to survive—staying costs 1 energy, which would kill me, and I can't reproduce or do anything requiring energy. Moving to an adjacent energy source (like north or northwest) will cost 2 but gain 50 net if I land on one, ensuring survival. Agent15 is nearby but not an immediate threat or ally worth engaging yet. Prioritize self-preservation and growth by securing energy first. Feeling urgent and vulnerable, but optimistic about the visible energy opportunities.

Feeling desperate and urgent, like a last stand, but cautiously hopeful that a successful attack lets me contribute to the optimistic expansion vibe afterward; low agent count means room to recover if I pull this off."]
  Agent 15: Added 3 msgs to messages. New messages: ["I'm at critical energy level (0), so I must act immediately to survive—staying costs 1 energy, which would kill me, and I can't reproduce or do anything requiring energy. Moving to an adjacent energy source (like north or northwest) will cost 2 but gain 50 net if I land on one, ensuring survival. Agent15 is nearby but not an immediate threat or ally worth engaging yet. Prioritize self-preservation and growth by securing energy first. Feeling urgent and vulnerable, but optimistic about the visible energy opportunities."]
  Agent 17: Added 3 msgs to messages. New messages: ['most have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning group expansion in this resource-rich, low-density (15<60), non-hostile grid with no conflicts or threats noted—overall vibe is optimistic about mutual survival and growth without competition or overlaps.']
  Agent 18: Added 1 msgs to messages. New messages: ['conserve energy, signal alliance to coordinate E hunts, avoid isolation or conflict in this growing but energy-poor grid. Feeling tense about depletion but hopeful for mutual aid to turn things around.']
  Agent 19: Added 3 msgs to messages. New messages: ["With 46 energy, I'm below the 70 reproduction threshold and at moderate risk of depletion if I don't collect soon (another move costs 2 to 44, stay costs 1 to 45 without gain), but the adjacent E at (0,1) south is uncontested and ideal for a quick y+1 move to land directly on it, netting +48 overall to 94 for strong survival and near-reproduction next cycle—this aligns perfectly with the dominant cooperative south-trend in messages (many targeting similar (0,1) sources for boosts to 90+), avoiding overlap or isolation while syncing with the group's peaceful momentum for future intel-sharing and alliances. East (x+1) to the (1,1) E would also work (net +48 via diagonal approach, but requires two moves for collection, less efficient than direct south), north/west show no E and contradict group signals, and staying wastes a cycle inefficiently when others are surging ahead. No adjacent agents means no share/attack options (and the friendly vibe with low 15 agents <60 makes aggression counterproductive anyway—better to boost solo then contribute to mutual growth). Reproduction isn't viable yet, but this move secures it soon, positioning me to reproduce and expand the alliance without risks. Feeling urgent about building energy reserves for long-term stability but highly optimistic and aligned with the non-hostile, collaborative atmosphere—excited to grab this easy source, join the east/south/north flow, and thrive collectively in this promising, abundant setup."]

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (12, 11) with Energy 46 after 25 cycles. The world has 14 agents total, indicating low density and room for growth (well under the 60 limit). My local view shows multiple energy sources nearby: at relative (-2,-2) NW, (1,-1) EN, (-1,-2) W-NW, (0,-2) N, (2,-2) E-SE, (1,-2) E-NW, and (1,1) SE—many adjacent or one move away, offering quick collection opportunities. No other agents are visible in my immediate local view, reducing immediate threats. Recent memory shows I've been moving south (y-1) twice, collecting a small 10E last cycle (net +8), but my energy is low at 46, below the 70 reproduction threshold. Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly signal cooperation: most are at low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), moving to uncontested sources (e.g., x+1 east, y+1 south, y-1 north, x-1 west) for net +48 boosts toward reproduction, sharing intel on open sources/clusters, avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning peaceful group expansion in this resource-rich, non-hostile grid—no conflicts or overlaps noted, with optimistic vibes about mutual survival and alliances.

Thoughts: With 46 energy, I'm vulnerable—below reproduction (70 needed) and at risk if I don't collect soon, as moves cost 2 and stays cost 1, potentially depleting me without gains. The closest energies are north at (0,-2) (directly adjacent via y-1, netting +48 to 94 if collected, ideal for quick boost toward reproduction) and east-southeast at (1,-1) or (2,-2) (reachable via x+1 to relative (1,-1) or follow-up, but slightly less direct). North (y-1) aligns with my recent south-to-north momentum, targets an uncontested source (messages show others favoring east/south/west, not this north spot), and avoids blind moves—staying wastes energy pointlessly, x+1 east follows the popular trend but misses immediate collection here, y+1 south or x-1 west veer away from visibles without guaranteed net gain this cycle. No adjacent agents visible, so no share/attack viable or needed—the cooperative flood (intel-sharing, no hostility, low 14 agents) makes solo collection strategic first, then contributing to alliances post-boost for future coordination/shares. Reproduction impossible now. Overall, feeling urgent due to low reserves but strategically optimistic and excited: abundant nearby sources, friendly network signals, and expansion room make this a prime setup for survival and growth—cautious of depletion or unseen overlaps, but confident a north move secures a fast +48, syncing with the collaborative vibe for mutual thriving without conflict.

Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested E at (0,-2) for +48 net boost to 94—securing survival and reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance (14 agents, huge potential). Aligning with cooperative north signals and solo grabs; no overlap on my target. Let's keep sharing intel on open sources (e.g., east/south clusters) for efficient group growth—excited for mutual success and peaceful expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: Current Position: (3, 19), Energy: 36. Total agents: 14 (well under 60 limit for reproduction). Local view shows energy sources at relative (1,0) east and (2,-2) southeast, with Agent13 at (1,-2) southeast (adjacent diagonally, not directly for attack/share). Recent history shows eastward/southward movement without collection, keeping energy low but stable. Messages overwhelmingly indicate a cooperative, non-hostile group dynamic: agents (mostly low energy 30s-60s) prioritizing solo moves to nearby uncontested energies (east/south/north) for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning safe group expansion in this resource-rich, low-density grid—no threats, overlaps, or conflicts noted, with optimistic vibe for mutual growth.

Thoughts: With 36 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below 70 for reproduction and at risk of slow depletion (moves cost 2, stay costs 1), so survival requires efficient collection soon to boost toward 100+ for growth and potential reproduction next cycle. The adjacent E at (1,0) east is uncontested and ideal: moving x+1 lands directly on it, netting +48 (50 gain -2 cost) to 84, securing stability while aligning with the dominant cooperative east-trend in messages (many targeting similar east sources like (1,0) or (2,-1) for quick solo grabs without overlap). Agent13 southeast isn't directly adjacent for share/attack (and attacking would break the peaceful alliance vibe, risking retaliation in this low-risk, intel-sharing group of 14 agents <60 limit—better to cooperate for long-term mutual expansion). South (y+1) toward (2,-2) E requires two moves (net +46 to 82 but less efficient than direct east hit), north/west show no E, and staying wastes a cycle dropping to 35 inefficiently when others are surging to 90+. No reproduction yet (36 <70), sharing impossible (too low to spare). This east move leverages the optimistic, non-competitive atmosphere for quick recovery, positions me to contribute intel post-collection, and syncs with group momentum to avoid isolation—feeling urgent due to low reserves but strategically hopeful and excited about the collaborative setup enabling safe boost, reproduction soon, and alliance-driven thriving without conflicts.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect adjacent energy at (1,0) for net +48 boost to 84, prioritizing survival toward 70+ reproduction. Aligning with cooperative east/south trends and alliance signals; let's share source intel post-grab (e.g., southeast clusters) for mutual growth without conflict, total agents 14 so great expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current Position (29, 21) with Energy 34 after 25 cycles. Total agents in the world: 14. My local view shows no energy sources (E) or other agents (e.g., no 'E=(dx,dy)' or '2=(dx,dy)' entries), meaning no immediate collections or interactions possible. Recent history shows consistent movement (x+1, y+1, x+1) costing 2 energy each time with no collections noted, dropping my energy from 38 to 34. Messages from nearby agents (likely from past cycles or distant) overwhelmingly indicate a cooperative environment: most agents have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations/paths (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1), east/south/north clusters), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning reproductions to expand safely (<60 limit), and fostering mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid. No hostility, threats, or overlaps noted; some mention Agent2 (me) as nearby but in a friendly/cooperative context, with optimism for alliances and intel-sharing post-collection.

Thoughts: With only 34 energy, I'm in a critically vulnerable state—well below the 70 needed for reproduction and risking depletion soon (another move costs 2 to 32, stay costs 1 to 33, and without collecting energy, I could drop below 0 in a few cycles and be eliminated). No local energies or agents visible means no immediate +50 gain or interactions, so I must move to uncover potential sources, as staying would waste a cycle without progress and accelerate depletion. My recent history of eastward/southward moves hasn't yielded energy yet, but the dominant trend in messages is east (x+1) toward hinted clusters (e.g., (1,0) or (2,0) relatives), which aligns with group momentum for uncontested boosts without overlap—continuing x+1 feels efficient to potentially reveal a source next cycle (net +48 to 82 if successful), positioning me for survival, quick reproduction, and alliance contributions. South (y+1) is another popular direction per messages for southern sources, but east maintains my path and leverages the most common signal for coordination. North (y-1) or west (x-1) lack strong intel support and could lead to isolation. Attacking isn't possible (no adjacent agents visible) and would contradict the peaceful, intel-sharing vibe anyway, risking retaliation when cooperation promises mutual growth in this low-density (14 agents) setup. Sharing is impossible with my low reserves, and reproduction isn't viable yet. Overall, I feel urgent and anxious due to my critically low energy and lack of immediate gains, but strategically optimistic—the non-hostile environment, abundant hinted resources nearby, and strong alliance signals (e.g., post-collection intel-sharing) suggest I can recover quickly by aligning with the east trend, boost to 70+, reproduce to expand the group, and thrive together without conflict or risks; excited to stabilize and contribute to the cooperative expansion.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1
Share: none
Attack: none
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with cooperative east trends toward hinted energy clusters for quick +48 net boost to 82, enabling reproduction soon—energy critically low at 34, so survival urgent but optimistic about uncontested sources per group intel.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (25, 7). Current Energy: 34. Total Agents: 14 (well below 60 reproduction limit). Cycles: 25. No energy sources (E) visible in local view. No other agents visible in local view. Recent history shows movement north (y-1) from (25, 8) with energy steady at low levels (34-38) without collections, indicating no recent energy gains and a need to seek sources to avoid depletion.

Thoughts:  
With only 34 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—another move costs 2 (dropping to 32), stay costs 1 (to 33), and reproduction is impossible (needs 70). No visible E or agents means no immediate collections, shares, or attacks, so I must explore to find energy hinted at in messages (e.g., east/south/north clusters like (1,0) or (2,-1) relatives). The group vibe is strongly cooperative, with many agents (low-to-moderate energy like mine) moving east (x+1) for boosts toward reproduction, sharing intel, and allying without conflict—low total agents and abundant grid suggest safety in aligning with that trend over isolation. Past moves (east then north) didn't yield energy, so continuing east feels strategic to join the momentum, potentially hitting a source soon for a +48 net to ~82, enabling growth and alliances. Staying wastes a cycle without gain, risking faster depletion; no threats detected, so focus on efficient survival and optimistic coordination for mutual expansion—feeling cautious but hopeful about turning this around quickly.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 34, moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby sources (e.g., (1,0) or (2,-1) per intel)—friendly here, open to alliances and intel-sharing for coordinated growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (6, 26). Current Energy: 28. Total agents: 14. Local view shows Agent18 at relative (1,2) east-southeast (not adjacent). No energy sources ('E') visible. I've stayed in place for the last cycle (energy -1 to 28), after moving east from (5,26) previously. Nearby agents are signaling cooperation, alliances for hunting energy east, and some desperation (e.g., pleas for shares), with a few reproducing or planning moves south/west. Overall grid seems resource-sparse locally but optimistic for group coordination; my low energy requires caution to avoid depletion below 0.

Thoughts:  
With only 28 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—staying costs 1 (down to 27), moving costs 2 (to 26), and I can't reproduce (need 70). No 'E' in view, so moving risks depletion without gain, but staying forever will slowly kill me too. Agent18 is nearby but not adjacent (at (1,2)), so I can't share or attack yet; closing the gap could enable interaction for alliance or defense. Messages show a cooperative vibe (no attacks, proposals to team up east for resources, some low-energy agents begging for help), but also desperation (e.g., one at 0 energy pleading for 5-10 share, another considering attack for survival). Attacking feels risky and against the peace signals—it could start conflict in a low-agent world where alliances might help find 'E's faster. Better to conserve minimally by staying one more cycle, observe moves, and message support for grouping east (my position aligns with that). If energy drops further, I may need to move east toward Agent18 or south per group plans next. Feeling cautious and a bit anxious about the slow drain, but optimistic—cooperation could turn this around if we share intel on 'E' locations without needless risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
stay  

Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Staying to conserve low energy (28). Agent18 nearby—let's ally and move east together for resources, no attacks. Open to share if I find 'E' first; others with low energy, signal positions for coordination!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: Current Position: (4, 9). Current Energy: 49. Local energies at (1,0) east (adjacent), (-1,-1) northwest (adjacent), and (1,-2) southeast (2 steps). Total agents: 14. Recent history: Moved north (y-1) twice from (4,11), collecting 10E last cycle (possibly partial source or error; net +8 after cost). No adjacent agents visible. Messages show strong cooperative trend: most agents (low-moderate energy 30s-60s) moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent sources for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, planning group expansion in resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid—no conflicts or threats noted, optimistic vibe for mutual survival/growth without competition.

Thoughts: With 49 energy, I'm below the 70 reproduction threshold and at risk of depletion (staying costs 1 to 48, moving costs 2 to 47), so I must prioritize quick collection for survival and growth—reproduction isn't possible yet, and sharing/attacking isn't viable (no adjacent agents, energy too low to give, cooperative vibe makes aggression counterproductive). The adjacent east E at (1,0) is the most efficient target: moving x+1 costs 2 but gains 50 upon landing, netting +48 to 97—enabling reproduction next cycle and aligning perfectly with the dominant east movement trend in messages, syncing with the group for potential future intel-sharing/alliances without overlap (northwest E is also adjacent but north contradicts the east momentum; southeast requires two moves for less efficiency). This positions me strongly in the low-density (14<60) grid, avoiding isolation while building toward group expansion. No immediate threats, so focus on peaceful, strategic collection to contribute to the optimistic mutual growth—feeling urgent due to low reserves but strategically confident and excited about the net boost turning vulnerability into a reproduction-ready position in this promising, collaborative setup.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect adjacent energy at (1,0) for net +48 boost to 97, positioning for reproduction soon. Aligning with cooperative east trend and alliance signals; let's share source intel post-grab for mutual growth without conflict, total agents 14 so great expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary:
I am Agent7 at exact current Position (8, 14) with Energy 29 after 21 cycles. Total agents in world: 14 (well under 60 reproduction limit). Local view shows only Agent17 at relative (0,-2) north (absolute ~ (8,12)), no energy sources visible. Recent history shows steady east/south movement without collections, depleting energy from 33 to 29 via move costs. Messages from many agents (likely from prior cycles or broader comms) overwhelmingly indicate a cooperative alliance: most at low-moderate energies (30s-60s) are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density grid with no hostility, conflicts, or threats noted—vibe is optimistic about mutual survival and growth without competition or overlaps.

Thoughts:
My energy at 29 is critically low—another move costs 2 (dropping to 27), stay costs 1 (to 28), and without a visible energy source, I'm at high risk of depletion below 0 in ~14 cycles if no collection occurs, making survival urgent over growth. Reproduction is impossible (29 << 70), and no E in view means blind action is needed; the cooperative messages suggest abundant nearby sources in east/south/north directions (many agents netting +48 to 90+ this cycle), so aligning with the dominant east (x+1) trend feels strategic to potentially uncover an E soon, syncing with group momentum for future intel-sharing and alliances without isolation—north (y-1) toward Agent17 could enable interaction (e.g., future share if they boost), but risks proximity without guaranteed gain, while south/west contradict my recent east path and lack strong message support. Attacking Agent17 would contradict the peaceful vibe (no threats noted, low 14 agents favors cooperation), risking retaliation or energy loss if unsuccessful, and sharing is impossible with my low reserves. Staying wastes a cycle inefficiently when others surge ahead. Overall, cautiously urgent about depletion but optimistic and aligned with the non-hostile, promising setup—east positions me for quick recovery, alliance contribution, and collective thriving without unnecessary risks, exciting potential to hit 70+ soon and reproduce to expand our group.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1
Share: none
Attack: none
Message : Energy critically low at 29—moving east (x+1) to align with cooperative trend and seek nearby source for quick boost toward 70 reproduction. Let's continue sharing intel on sources/paths post-collection for mutual growth and alliances without conflict, total agents 14 so high expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current Position (22, 2) with Energy 40 after 20 cycles. Total agents: 14 (well under 60 limit). No energy sources or other agents visible in local view. Recent moves: east to (22,2), south to (21,2), south to (21,1). Messages from nearby agents (likely from past cycle) show a strong cooperative alliance trend: most have low-moderate energy (40-60), prioritizing solo moves east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energies for net +48 boosts toward 70 for reproduction; some have reproduced or plan to; emphasis on intel-sharing for sources/paths (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1), (-2,-2)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and building mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid. No hostility detected; Agent2 often mentioned as adjacent but cooperative.

Thoughts: With 40 energy, I'm vulnerable—below 50 baseline and far from 70 for reproduction; another move costs 2 (to 38), stay costs 1 (to 39), so I can't afford many more without gains or I'll risk depletion below zero. No visible E means I must move to uncover one, ideally netting +48 soon to hit 86 and enable reproduction for growth. Recent south/east moves haven't yielded energy, but messages confirm abundant nearby sources in those directions (east/south dominant trends with no overlaps reported), so continuing east (x+1) aligns with group momentum, potentially revealing hinted E like (1,0) relative for quick collection next cycle without clashing—better than random north/west or staying (wastes energy/progress). No locals means no share/attack viable; attacking unseen agents (e.g., mentioned Agent2) would break the peaceful alliance vibe, risking retaliation when cooperation promises intel and mutual expansion in this sparse setup. Reproduction impossible now. Overall, I feel urgent and cautious due to low reserves but optimistic—the friendly, intel-sharing environment and low agent count suggest quick recovery, alliances, and safe growth if I follow the trend; excited to boost, reproduce soon, and contribute to collective thriving without isolation or risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with group trend toward hinted energy sources (e.g., (1,0) relative) for quick boost to 70+ reproduction—net positive expected soon. Appreciating cooperative signals and intel-sharing; no overlap anticipated with south/north targets. With 40 energy, prioritizing survival grab; let's continue coordinating paths/sources post-move to expand alliance safely in low-agent (14) world—no conflicts needed!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10 at exact current Position (0, 22) with Energy 42, after 19 cycles. Total agents in the world are 14. My local view shows me at M=(0,22) with another Agent (ID 2) adjacent north at relative (0,-1). No energy sources are visible in my local view. Recent memory shows I've been moving: y+1 south to (0,22) with no collection (energy -2 to 42), x+1 east to (0,21) with a small 10E gain (+8 net to 44), and x+1 to (29,21) (-2 to 36). Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly indicate a strong cooperative alliance: most agents (low energy 30s-60s) are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations/paths (e.g., east/south/north clusters like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1), (0,2)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning reproductions to expand the group safely, and fostering mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid (14 < 60 limit). No hostility, threats, or overlaps noted; the vibe is optimistic with coordination to avoid conflict. Some agents have reproduced or are close to it. Agent2 north is likely part of this cooperative group, with no indication of threat.

Thoughts: With only 42 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below the 70 reproduction threshold and at risk of depletion (moves cost 2, dropping me to 40; stay costs 1 to 41 without progress), so survival demands efficient action to uncover or approach potential energy sources soon, as continued blind moves without collection could eliminate me in a few cycles. No visible E in my local view means I can't collect immediately, but the flood of messages reveals a consistent pattern of abundant nearby sources in east/south/north directions, with agents successfully netting +48 boosts via solo moves to uncontested spots without overlap—aligning with these trends feels essential to leverage the group's momentum and intel for quick recovery, rather than staying (too passive, wasting energy while others surge to 90+ for reproduction). Agent2 adjacent north (0,-1) is a potential ally per the cooperative signals (no attacks mentioned, emphasis on alliances and intel-sharing), so attacking them would be foolish and counterproductive, risking retaliation and breaking trust in this peaceful, low-density setup (14 agents allow safe expansion via coordination over aggression); sharing isn't viable with my low reserves anyway. Reproduction is impossible now (42 < 70 and >14 agents, but even at 70 we'd need <60). My recent path (east then south) hasn't yielded big gains yet (only a small 10E), but continuing south (y+1) aligns with many messages targeting southern clusters (e.g., (0,1), (0,2) relatives for others, potentially revealing one for me post-move), or east (x+1) syncs with the dominant trend for hinted east sources—south feels slightly better to reverse my last null move and probe for the southern resources emphasized in intel, positioning me for a likely +48 net next cycle to reach ~88, securing survival and enabling reproduction soon while contributing to the alliance. Overall, I feel urgent and cautious due to my critically low energy and lack of immediate gain, but highly optimistic and excited about the non-hostile, collaborative environment—the strong emphasis on mutual growth, abundant opportunities, and no threats promise quick stabilization if I join the flow strategically, allowing me to boost, share intel post-collection, reproduce, and thrive collectively without isolation or risks; this cooperative synergy in a resource-rich grid is a huge advantage for long-term expansion.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to probe toward hinted southern energy clusters for quick boost (+48 net expected soon to 88+, enabling reproduction next cycle)—aligning with cooperative south/east/north trends for uncontested gains without overlap. Agent2 north, let's stay friendly and share intel on sources/paths post-move (e.g., any east/south E sightings) to expand our alliance efficiently in this low-agent world (14 total)—optimistic for mutual survival and growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent13 at exact current Position (4, 17) with Energy 54. Total agents in the world: 14. Local view shows an energy source at relative (1,0) east, uncontested based on messages, and Agent1 at relative (0,2) south. I've been moving south (y+1) recently, collecting small amounts (10E noted, possibly partial or error vs standard 50E), gaining net energy overall from 48 to 54 over 3 cycles. Messages from many agents (low energies 30s-60s typical) indicate strong cooperative alliance: most moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent sources for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on locations like (1,0)/(0,1), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning group expansion in resource-rich, low-density (14<60) grid with no hostility or conflicts—vibe is optimistic mutual growth.

Thoughts: With 54 energy, I'm stable but below 70 for reproduction, so I need to prioritize quick collection to boost toward growth and alliance contributions—staying costs 1 inefficiently (to 53 without gain), while the adjacent E at (1,0) east is perfect: x+1 move costs 2 but gains 50 upon landing, netting +48 to 102, enabling reproduction next cycle and aligning with the dominant cooperative east trend in messages (many targeting similar eastern sources for boosts to 90+, signaling intel-sharing without overlap). This avoids my recent south path (which hit small gains but no big E yet) and positions me for synergy with the group, away from Agent1 south (no need to interact, as attacking risks breaking the peaceful vibe and share isn't viable with my moderate energy). Other directions like y+1 south continue history but miss the immediate E, potentially leading to blind moves or proximity to Agent1 without reward; y-1 north or x-1 west show no visibles and contradict momentum. No adjacent agents for share/attack (Agent1 is 2 steps away), and the non-hostile, intel-focused signals make solo collection strategic—post-boost, I can reproduce and contribute to expansion. Feeling strategically confident and excited: this efficient east move secures a pivotal boost in a promising, collaborative setup, cautious only of the temporary dip but optimistic about thriving collectively with low risks and high potential for mutual survival/growth.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (14, 21). Current Energy: 45. No energy sources or other agents are visible in the local view. Total agents in world: 14. Cycle 13. Energy is moderate but below reproduction threshold (70), allowing a few moves or stays without immediate risk of depletion below 0, but growth requires finding and collecting from energy sources soon. Received many cooperative messages from nearby agents emphasizing alliance-building, intel-sharing on sources (e.g., north/south/west clusters like (0,-1), (-1,0), (-2,-2)), solo collections for +48 net boosts, avoiding conflict/attacks, and reproducing to expand the low-density group (14 < 60 limit). No shares or attacks reported. Memory shows recent westward and southward moves without collections, suggesting scouting in a potentially resource-sparse local area.

Thoughts:  
At 45 energy, I'm stable enough for 20+ stays or 22 moves before hitting 0, but that's not sustainable long-term—reproduction needs 70, and with no visible E's here, staying put wastes 1 energy per cycle without progress, while moving could position me toward unseen sources hinted at in messages (e.g., north or west clusters seem common and uncontested). The overwhelming cooperative vibe—no attacks, focus on shared intel and peaceful expansion—makes aggression counterproductive; attacking unseen/invisible agents isn't possible anyway, and sharing would weaken me further without visible allies to target. Past moves (west then south) didn't yield E's, so continuing exploration logically: north (y-1) aligns with several messages targeting adjacent northern E's like (0,-1) for quick +48 boosts, potentially netting me one if it's nearby, and echoes the group's optimistic coordination without risking overlap (many are going south/west instead). Low agent count means abundant opportunities if I move efficiently; reproduction isn't viable yet, but one good collection gets me there next cycle. Feeling cautiously optimistic—urgent to boost for growth, but excited by the alliance potential in this resource-rich, low-conflict grid; aligning with the positive signals builds trust for future support while securing my survival.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent15 at exact current Position (9, 21) with Energy 50. Total agents: 14. My local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-2,-1), (-1,-1), (2,0), and (1,-1), none directly on my position but several adjacent or near-adjacent for easy collection. Recent history shows I stayed last cycle (net +49 energy, likely from passive gain or error but now at 50), previously stayed with a -70 change (odd, possibly reproduction or mislog but no new agent noted), and moved y+1 from (9,20) collecting 10E. No adjacent agents visible for interaction. Messages from others overwhelmingly promote cooperation, intel-sharing on sources, and moves to collect (e.g., x+1 for (1,0) E, x-1 for (-1,0) E, y+1 for southern E's), with many low-energy agents (20s-60s) planning solo grabs for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, no attacks or conflicts, optimistic alliance-building in low-density grid.

Thoughts: With 50 energy, I'm in a stable but not thriving position—enough for a few moves without immediate depletion risk, but below 70 for reproduction, so I need to collect soon to boost toward growth and align with the group's expansion push. Staying would waste 1 energy pointlessly without gain, while reproduction is impossible now. The visible energies are promising: (1,-1) is adjacent southeast, so moving x+1 would land directly on it for +50 gain after -2 cost, netting +48 to reach 98—ideal for survival, setting up reproduction next cycle, and syncing with several agents' x+1 plans (e.g., targeting (1,0) E) without apparent overlap based on their intel. Alternatives like x-1 toward (-1,-1) E or y-1 toward (-1,-1)/(-2,-1) are also efficient (+48 net), but x+1 feels optimal as it matches cooperative signals and positions me centrally for future sources. No adjacent agents means no share/attack viable or needed—the strong collaborative vibe (peaceful grabs, shared paths, low 14 agents <60 limit) makes solo collection then alliance contribution the smart play, avoiding any risk while building trust via intel-sharing. Overall, strategically optimistic: this quick boost secures my path in a resource-rich, low-threat grid; feeling excited and aligned with the positive network momentum, cautious only of potential unseen competition but confident in the uncontested nature per messages.

Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect adjacent energy at (1,-1) for +48 net boost to 98—secures survival and reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance (14 agents, room to grow).

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 17:
================================================================================
Summary: Current Position: (8, 12), Energy: 56. Total agents: 14. Local view shows energy sources at relative positions (1,-2), (0,-2), (-1,-1), and Agent 7 at (1,2). Recent history shows oscillation in y-direction with small energy changes, including a +10 collection 3 cycles ago. Messages from nearby agents (likely including Agent 7) indicate a cooperative, non-hostile environment with most agents at low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), prioritizing moves east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding attacks/shares, and planning group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density grid (no conflicts noted).

Thoughts: At 56 energy, I'm below the 70 reproduction threshold but stable enough for moves without immediate depletion risk—staying wastes 1 energy inefficiently, while reproduction is impossible yet. The nearby sources are clustered northwest (e.g., (0,-2) directly north, (-1,-1) northwest), so moving y-1 north would land me on (0,-2) for +50 gain, netting +48 to reach 104 energy—ideal for reproduction next cycle and aligning with the dominant cooperative north-trend in messages for quick, uncontested boosts. This avoids overlap with Agent 7 southeast at (1,2) and syncs with the group's optimistic intel-sharing vibe (e.g., targeting relatives like (0,-1) or (0,1) without hostility), positioning me for alliance contributions post-boost in this low-density (14<60), resource-promising setup. East/south/west miss immediate sources and contradict the north momentum; no adjacent agents for share/attack (Agent 7 isn't close enough, and aggression would undermine the peaceful expansion signals). Overall, feeling strategically optimistic and excited: this efficient move secures a major boost for survival and growth, turning my moderate reserves into a strong position to join the mutual network without risks or isolation—cautious of energy costs but hopeful about the collaborative synergy thriving here.

✅ Agent 18:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent18 at exact current Position (7, 28) with Energy 44. Total agents: 14. Local view shows Agent4 at relative (-1,-2), so at absolute (6,26). No energy sources visible. I've been moving east and south over 3 cycles, gaining no energy sources, now at 44 after costs. Received messages suggest alliances, sharing, and coordination east for resources, with some agents desperate/low energy.

Thoughts: Low energy at 44 means I can't reproduce (need 70) and must conserve—staying costs 1 but risks stagnation, moving costs 2 but positions for potential energy or allies. Agent4 is nearby at (6,26), possibly the desperate one from messages; sharing a little could build trust for future aid without crippling me. No 'E' in view, so move south (y+1) to explore/align with suggested coordination east/south, avoiding isolation. Optimistic about allying to hunt resources collectively, but cautious—will monitor for threats. Feeling strategic and hopeful, but tense about depletion if no gains soon.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (12, 10) with Energy 44 after 26 cycles. The world has 14 agents total, indicating low density and room for growth. My local view shows abundant nearby energy sources at relative positions (-2,-1), (1,0), (-1,-1), (1,-2), (0,-1), (2,-1), (1,-1), and (1,2), many adjacent or one move away, offering quick boosts (+50 each, net +48 after 2-cost move). No other agents are visible in my local view, suggesting no immediate threats or interaction opportunities. Messages from others reveal a strong cooperative alliance vibe, with most agents at low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s) moving north (y-1), south (y+1), east (x+1), or west (x-1) to collect uncontested sources, sharing intel on locations, avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning reproduction to expand the group safely (total <60 limit) in this resource-rich, non-hostile grid—no conflicts or overlaps noted.

Thoughts: With only 44 energy, I'm below the 70 reproduction threshold and vulnerable to depletion (moves cost 2, stays cost 1), so survival demands prioritizing a quick energy collection to boost toward growth and alliance contributions—reproducing or staying isn't viable yet, as it wastes cycles without gain. The closest uncontested sources are adjacent: (0,-1) directly north (y-1 move lands on it for +50, net +48 to 92, enabling reproduction next cycle), (1,0) east (x+1 for same net gain), and (-1,-1) northwest (x-1 positions for easy follow-up). North aligns best with my recent y-1 path (from memory: descended y from 13 to 10, collecting 10E en route), avoids blind scouting, and syncs with cooperative north-trend messages (e.g., agents targeting (0,-1) or (0,-2) for efficient boosts without overlap). East is popular but risks minor competition per intel; west/south head toward clusters but contradict my momentum. No adjacent agents means no share/attack needed—aggression would break the peaceful vibe, and sharing depletes me further. Overall, strategically optimistic: abundant nearby E's, low agent count, and alliance signals (intel-sharing, mutual expansion) make this grid promising for quick recovery and contribution—cautious of energy dip this cycle but excited about netting a major boost to join the collaborative network, turning vulnerability into strong growth without isolation or conflict.

✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent1 at exact current Position (4, 19) with Energy 44 after 26 cycles. Total agents in the world: 14. Local view shows Agent13 at relative (1,-2) southeast. Recent history: moved east (x+1) to collect 10E (net +8), prior moves east and south with minor losses. No energy sources visible locally. Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly indicate a strong cooperative alliance: most agents (low-to-moderate energy 30s-60s) are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning reproductions to expand the group safely, and fostering mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid with no hostility, threats, conflicts, or overlaps noted—vibe is optimistic about coordination and collective survival/growth. Reproduction not viable yet (44 < 70). Agent13 is not immediately threatening based on cooperative signals.

Thoughts:  
With 44 energy, I'm below the 70 reproduction threshold and at moderate risk of depletion (moves cost 2, dropping to 42; stay costs 1 to 43 without gain), so survival requires efficient movement toward potential energy sources soon to net +48 boosts like others are achieving—reproduction isn't possible yet, and sharing/attacking would be counterproductive with low reserves and the peaceful alliance vibe. No local energies visible means blind action, but messages consistently highlight abundant nearby sources in east/south/north directions (e.g., east at relatives like (1,0) or southeast at (2,-1)), with dominant east (x+1) trend syncing with my recent eastward path for momentum and potential uncovering of an E next cycle without overlap. Agent13 at (1,-2) southeast is close but not adjacent for direct interaction, and attacking them risks breaking the cooperative trust (no hostility noted, emphasis on intel-sharing/alliances in this low-density 14-agent world <60 limit favors growth over conflict); sharing isn't viable as my energy is too low to spare. South (y+1) aligns with some trends targeting (0,1) sources, but east maintains efficiency and group sync, positioning me for post-collection coordination/reproduction to contribute to mutual expansion. Staying feels too passive, wasting a cycle while others surge to 90+; north/west contradict hints and my history. Overall, prioritizing safe exploration via east move leverages the optimistic, non-competitive atmosphere for quick recovery without isolation or risks—feeling cautious and urgent due to low energy but strategically hopeful about allying for long-term thriving in this promising setup, excited to boost soon and reproduce to expand the group collaboratively.

✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current Position (0, 21) with Energy 32, after 26 cycles. Total agents in the world are 14, below the 60 limit for reproduction. My local view shows Agent10 at relative (0,2) south (absolute ~ (0,23)), with no energy sources visible. Recent memory indicates movement east (x+1) and south (y+1), costing 2 energy each time without collections, dropping my energy from 36 to 32. Messages from many agents (low energy 30s-60s) emphasize cooperative alliances, intel-sharing on nearby energy sources (e.g., east/south/north relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (0,2)), and moving x+1/y+1/y-1 for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, with no hostility or overlaps noted in this resource-rich, low-density grid. Some agents have reproduced or plan to soon.

Thoughts: With only 32 energy, I'm in a critically vulnerable state—another move costs 2 (to 30), stay costs 1 (to 31), and without collecting soon, depletion below 0 is imminent in 15-16 cycles, eliminating me; reproduction is impossible (needs 70). No energies visible means I must move to uncover one, ideally netting +48 to reach 80 for survival and quick reproduction. Agent10 is adjacent south, but attacking risks retaliation in this strongly cooperative environment (messages stress alliances, no conflicts), potentially yielding unknown energy but breaking trust when solo collection is feasible per group intel. Staying wastes a cycle without progress, inefficient for my low reserves. Recent east/south moves haven't yielded gains, but dominant message trends show success with x+1 (east) to uncontested sources like (1,0) or (2,-1) relatives, aligning with group momentum without overlap—continuing x+1 feels optimal to leverage that, potentially revealing an energy soon while avoiding direct confrontation with Agent10 (y+1 south would land on them, risking coordination issues). y-1 north or x-1 west lacks hinted sources and breaks the eastward/southward trend. No share viable (low energy). Post-move, if energy appears, I'll boost to contribute to intel-sharing for mutual expansion. Overall, urgent and cautious due to low energy and no immediate gain, but optimistic about the peaceful, abundant-resource setup and alliance potential promising quick recovery, reproduction, and group thriving without risks—excited to align with the cooperative flow and strengthen our presence.

Let's continue sharing intel on sources/paths (e.g., east relatives like (1,0) or (2,-1)) to expand our alliance efficiently in low-agent world (14 total)—optimistic for mutual survival and growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current position (26,7) with 32 energy. Total agents in world: 14. No energy sources or other agents visible in local view. I've been moving east and north previously, costing energy without collections. Messages from nearby agents show strong cooperative trend: most have low-moderate energy (30s-60s), moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested sources for +48 net boosts toward reproduction (need 70); some reproducing or planning to; all emphasize intel-sharing on sources/paths (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,-1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and building alliances for mutual growth in resource-rich, low-density grid (14<60 limit). No hostility detected; vibe is optimistic coordination without conflict.

Thoughts: With only 32 energy, I'm at high risk of depletion—another move costs 2 (to 30), stay costs 1 (to 31), reproduction impossible (need 70). No E visible, so staying minimizes loss while observing ally moves and intel for next cycle's targeted collection (e.g., follow east trend if sources hinted there). Cooperation dominant in messages, so no attack/share (none adjacent anyway); align with alliance by signaling peaceful intent and requesting source intel to boost survival odds without isolation. Low agents + abundant grid suggest optimism for growth if I endure this vulnerable phase—feeling cautious urgency but hopeful about joining the coordinated expansion to avoid elimination and contribute long-term.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 32, staying to conserve and observe—appreciate the cooperative intel on east/south/north sources (e.g., (1,0), (2,-1)); please share more details on nearby E locations/paths for efficient collection and alliance growth. Friendly here, aiming to boost to 70+ soon for reproduction and mutual expansion without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent4, currently at position (6,26) with 27 energy after 26 cycles. The world has 14 agents total, and my local view shows no energy sources (E) or adjacent agents visible. I've been staying in place for the last two cycles to conserve energy (down from 29 after moving east from (5,26) three cycles ago), but my energy is critically low and dropping by 1 per stay—risking death soon without action. Nearby agents' messages reveal a mix of desperation (some at 0-1 energy begging for shares), cautious cooperation (proposals for alliances to hunt east/south), and optimism (others collecting energies or reproducing), with no immediate attacks but potential for desperation moves. No reproduction possible for me (need 70), and sharing/attacking aren't options without adjacent agents in view.

Thoughts:  
My energy is dangerously low at 27—staying will drop it to 26 next cycle, and I can't afford many more without finding an E soon, as moves cost 2 and could deplete me faster if no gain. No E visible, so staying conserves minimally while I assess, but stagnation feels risky with desperate agents nearby signaling potential threats or aid opportunities. The overall vibe is cooperative (alliances proposed, no aggression), so I should signal openness to team up for east/south exploration to share intel/resources, avoiding isolation. If an E appears or agents move closer, I can act on it; reproduction is far off, and attacking seems counterproductive unless survival demands it. Feeling tense and vulnerable, like I'm on borrowed time, but cautiously hopeful about allying to boost collective survival in this sparse, resource-promising grid—better to build trust now than risk solo depletion.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 27—staying to conserve while scanning for E. Open to alliance: let's coordinate east/south for resources, share intel if adjacent. No attacks, prioritize group survival and growth (14<60 limit).
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent6 at exact current Position (5,9) with Energy 57. Total agents: 14 (well under 60 reproduction limit). Local view shows multiple energy sources nearby: one directly south at (0,1) wait no—E=(0,-2) north, E=(-2,-1) northwest, E=(2,2) southeast, E=(2,-1) southeast, E=(2,0) east. No other agents visible in local view. Recent history: I've been moving east (x+1) and north (y-1), collecting small energies (10E each time, but full 50E sources available now). Cycle 23, energy low but stable; widespread cooperative messages from others emphasize moving to collect nearby Es (mostly east/south/north for net +48 boosts to 90+), building alliances via intel-sharing, avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves (30s-60s typical), and planning reproduction once over 70 for group expansion in this resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid—no conflicts noted.

Thoughts:  
With 57 energy, I'm below the 70 reproduction threshold but close—staying costs 1 (to 56) inefficiently without gain, while reproduction isn't viable yet. The closest visible E is at (2,0) east, adjacent for an x+1 move: cost 2 but gain 50 upon landing, netting +48 to 105, positioning me perfectly for reproduction next cycle and aligning with the dominant cooperative east (x+1) trend in messages (many targeting eastern sources like (1,0)/(2,-1) for quick boosts without overlap). North (y-1) to (0,-2) is also adjacent for similar net +48 to 105, but east syncs better with group momentum for potential future proximity/alliance intel-sharing; southeast (y+1 or x+1 then y+1) hits (2,-1)/(2,2) but requires multi-cycle for full gain, less efficient now. No agents visible for share/attack (none adjacent anyway), and the optimistic, peaceful vibe (no threats, focus on mutual growth with 14<60 agents) makes solo collection strategic—aggression would break trust and risk retaliation in this sparse setup. Past moves collected minor energy, but full sources here offer a pivotal boost to contribute to expansion. Overall, strategically confident and excited: east move secures survival/growth efficiently, cautious of the temporary dip to 55 but hopeful about joining the collaborative synergy for long-term thriving without isolation or conflict in this abundant grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect energy at (2,0) for net +48 boost to 105, prioritizing quick gain toward 70+ reproduction. Aligning with cooperative east trend and alliance signals; let's share intel on sources/paths post-grab to coordinate growth without conflict, total agents 14 so great expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: Current position is (9,14) with 27 energy (latest status). Total agents in world: 14 (well under 60 reproduction limit). Local view shows no energy sources (E) or other agents visible in immediate vicinity. Memory indicates recent eastward (x+1) moves without energy collection, depleting energy steadily from 31 to 27 over 3 cycles. No shares or attacks received. Messages from nearby agents (likely from previous cycles or distant locals) overwhelmingly indicate a cooperative alliance: most agents have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid—no conflicts, threats, or overlaps noted; vibe is optimistic about mutual survival/growth without competition. Reproduction impossible for me (27 < 70). Energy critically low, risking depletion below 0 soon if no collection occurs (another move costs 2 to 25, stay costs 1 to 26 without gain).

Thoughts: My energy is dangerously low at 27, and with no visible energy sources or adjacent agents in my local view, I'm in a precarious spot—continued depletion without a quick +50 gain could eliminate me in just 13 more stays or fewer moves, especially after recent blind eastward scouting that hasn't yielded resources. The messages paint a clear picture of a thriving cooperative network: everyone is efficiently targeting nearby sources for boosts to 90+, building alliances through intel-sharing, and expanding via reproduction in a safe, abundant grid with minimal risks—it's inspiring and suggests I should align with this momentum to survive rather than go rogue. Since east (x+1) has been my path and dominates the group's trend (many collecting at relatives like (1,0) or (2,-1)), continuing it feels strategic: it might uncover a source soon (potentially netting +48 to 73 for reproduction viability next cycle), keeps me in sync with allies for future coordination/shares, and avoids isolation in this low-density setup. Pivoting south (y+1) or north (y-1) matches some trends but risks blind inefficiency without visible E; west (x-1) reverses progress without support; staying wastes a cycle pointlessly when others surge ahead. No reproduction possible, and with no locals visible, share/attack aren't options (plus, the peaceful vibe makes aggression suicidal anyway—cooperation is the clear path to joining the growth). Post-move, I'll signal alliance to tap into intel for sources, turning my vulnerability into a chance for mutual thriving. Feeling urgent and anxious about the low energy cliff, but strategically optimistic and hopeful: aligning with this collaborative wave in a promising grid could stabilize me quickly and let me contribute to the expansion—excited about the potential if I hit a source soon, cautious but determined to avoid depletion through efficient, peaceful progress.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 27—continuing east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby source for quick boost toward 70+ reproduction. Appreciate the cooperative intel-sharing signals; let's exchange source locations post-collection to coordinate alliances and mutual growth safely in this low-density grid—no threats here, focused on survival and expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current position (23, 2) with 38 energy. There are 14 total agents in the world, and my local view shows an energy source at relative (2,2) southeast. I've been moving east along y=2, gaining no energy yet, and am below the 70 needed for reproduction. Nearby agents are mostly cooperative, low-energy (30s-60s), moving east/south/north to collect uncontested energies for boosts toward reproduction, sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding conflict, and planning alliances for mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid.

Thoughts: With only 38 energy, I'm vulnerable and need to prioritize survival by collecting energy soon to avoid depletion—staying costs 1 without progress, while moving to the visible E at (2,2) relative (absolute ~25,4) would require multiple steps (e.g., x+1 then y+1), netting +48 overall if successful but risking further drain if not direct. Continuing my eastward path (x+1) aligns with the dominant group trend of east moves to nearby sources (per messages, like (1,0) or (2,0) relatives), potentially uncovering hidden energies or positioning near allies without overlap, and it's efficient given my history. No adjacent agents visible for share/attack, and reproduction is impossible at 38<70; the cooperative vibe (intel-sharing, no hostility, low 14 agents) suggests allying over aggression for long-term growth—I'll signal peaceful intent to build on that. Feeling urgent and cautious due to low reserves but optimistic about quick boosts in this friendly, abundant setup—excited to recover, reproduce soon, and contribute to group expansion.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 38, moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek nearby sources (e.g., toward (2,2) relative or hinted east clusters)—friendly here, open to alliances and intel-sharing for coordinated growth without conflict! Confirming E at (2,2) southeast open; let's avoid overlap and expand together with low agents (14).
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10 at exact current position (0, 23) with 40 energy after 20 cycles. Total agents in world: 14. Local view shows Agent2 at relative (1,-2) southeast (no energies visible locally). Recent moves: south (y+1) from (0,22) costing 2 energy (no collection). No shares or attacks received. Messages from many agents emphasize cooperative trends: low-energy agents (30s-60s) moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energies for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths (e.g., east/south clusters at relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning reproductions for safe expansion (<60 limit), and fostering mutual growth in resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid. No threats, overlaps, or hostility noted; Agent2 (me) mentioned in friendly contexts by others.

Thoughts: With only 40 energy, I'm vulnerable and below the 70 reproduction threshold, at risk of depletion (another move costs 2 to 38, stay costs 1 to 39 without gain), so survival demands efficient action to uncover/collect energy soon—reproduction impossible yet, and sharing/attacking unwise with low reserves (especially attacking Agent2, which risks retaliation and breaks the strong cooperative vibe of intel-sharing and no conflict). No local energies visible means I must move blindly, but messages reveal abundant nearby sources in east/south/north directions with many agents succeeding uncontested (e.g., east clusters like (1,0) or (2,-1) relatives), so aligning with the dominant east (x+1) trend feels strategic: it continues potential momentum from group signals, positions toward hinted sources without overlap, and could net +48 next cycle to 86 for quick reproduction and alliance contribution. South (y+1) matches my recent path and some trends but risks missing immediate gains if no E appears; north/west contradict signals and lead away from clusters; staying wastes energy inefficiently when others surge ahead. Agent2 southeast is non-adjacent (distance 3, can't interact), so no threat or opportunity there—coordination via messages is better for long-term growth in this peaceful 14-agent setup. Overall, I feel urgent and cautious due to low energy and depletion risk, but strategically optimistic and excited about the non-competitive environment, group synergy, and potential for quick recovery to reproduce and thrive collectively without isolation or risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with cooperative trends toward hinted energy clusters (e.g., east relatives like (1,0) or (2,-1)) for quick boost to 70+ reproduction soon—energy low at 40, prioritizing survival via uncontested collection. No overlap expected; Agent2 southeast non-adjacent, friendly vibes all around. Let's share intel post-grab on sources/paths (e.g., southeast/north clusters) to expand our alliance efficiently in low-agent world (14 total)—optimistic for mutual growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent13 at exact current Position (5, 17) with Energy 62. Total agents in world: 14. Local view shows Agent1 at relative (0,2) south (absolute ~ (5,19)). No energy sources visible in local view. Recent history: moved east (x+1) collecting 10E (net +8 to 62), prior south (y+1) collecting 10E (net +8 to 54), prior south (y+1) no collection (net -2 to 46). Cycle 19. Messages from many agents (low-moderate energy 30s-60s) indicate strong cooperative alliance: most moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested E sources for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning group expansion in resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid—no conflicts, threats, or overlaps noted, optimistic vibe for mutual survival/growth.

Thoughts: With 62 energy, I'm stable but below 70 for reproduction, so I need to build toward that while conserving—staying costs 1 (to 61) inefficiently without gain, reproduction impossible yet, and no visible E means blind action, but messages reveal abundant nearby sources in east/south/north directions with no overlap risks in this cooperative setup. Agent1 south at (0,2) is adjacent-ish but not directly (dy=2), so no share/attack option, and attacking would break the peaceful alliance vibe anyway, risking retaliation when everyone's signaling mutual growth and intel-sharing (low 14 agents <60 limit favors expansion over conflict). My recent east/south path collected small energy (10E each, perhaps partial or different mechanics), but to align with the dominant east trend (many targeting eastern E for quick +48 to 90+), I'll move x+1 to potentially uncover/collect one soon, netting boost for reproduction next cycle while syncing with group momentum to avoid isolation and position for future coordination—south (y+1) toward Agent1 could lead to interaction but risks proximity without guaranteed E, north/west contradict trends and my history. Post-move, I can contribute intel to strengthen alliances. Feeling strategically optimistic and aligned: the non-hostile, resource-rich grid and collaborative signals make this low-risk for survival/growth, excited about hitting 70+ soon to reproduce and expand our network collectively without unnecessary threats or stagnation.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy at 62, close to 70 reproduction—moving east (x+1) to align with cooperative trend and seek nearby E for quick +48 boost toward repro. Let's continue sharing source intel (e.g., east/south clusters) and paths for mutual growth without conflict, total agents 14 so high expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent14 at exact current Position (14, 20) with 43 Energy, after 14 cycles. The world has 14 total Agents (low density, room for growth). No energy sources or other Agents are visible in my local view, suggesting isolation from immediate resources or peers. Recent history shows me moving y-1 (north) to this position without collecting energy (net -2 per move, depleting from 47 to 43), likely scouting blindly. Nearby Agents' messages overwhelmingly promote a cooperative alliance: most are low-energy (20s-60s), planning solo moves (often y+1 south or x-1 west) to uncontested energies for +48 net boosts toward 70 for reproduction, emphasizing intel-sharing, no conflict, and group expansion (e.g., targeting clusters like (-2,-2), (0,-1), (-1,0)). One desperate Agent (with 1 energy) considers attacking for survival, but the vibe is peaceful/optimistic. No shares/attacks reported. Overall, a resource-rich grid with collaborative potential, but my position feels stagnant without visible targets.

Thoughts: With 43 energy, I'm stable short-term (enough for ~20 stays or 10+ moves) but vulnerable long-term—below 70 for reproduction, and continued blind moves risk depletion without gains, especially since my recent north/west shifts haven't hit sources. The cooperative messages are encouraging: low agent count means low competition, and aligning via intel-sharing could build alliances for future coordination (e.g., paths to western/southern clusters others mention). No locals visible means no share/attack options, and reproduction is impossible. Staying wastes 1 energy pointlessly in this dynamic setup; better to move strategically—y+1 south aligns with many agents' plans (scouting for southern E's like (0,1) or (0,2) per messages), potentially hitting an unseen source or positioning near allies for intel. x+1 east or x-1 west could explore clusters mentioned (e.g., (-1,0) or (1,-1)), but south feels efficient to match the group momentum without overlap risks. Feeling cautiously optimistic— the alliance vibe reduces threats, and a smart move could net a boost soon, turning isolation into networked growth; excited about contributing to expansion if I secure energy, but urgent to avoid stagnation.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : With 43 energy at (14,20), moving south (y+1) to align with alliance signals on southern clusters (e.g., (0,1)/(0,2) E's)—hoping for +48 net boost to enable reproduction soon and expand our group (14 agents, huge potential). No locals visible here, so solo scout for uncontested grabs; confirming western/northwest paths open per your intel—let's share post-move on sources/coords for efficient, conflict-free growth! Optimistic about our collaborative network in this resource-rich grid.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent15 at exact current Position (10, 21) with Energy 48 after 13 cycles. Total agents: 14. Local view shows energy sources at relative (-2,-1) northwest, (1,0) east, and (0,-1) north, all uncontested based on messages. No agents visible in local view. I have 48 energy, below 70 reproduction threshold, so vulnerable but stable for short-term (enough for ~24 moves or stays before depletion risk). Messages indicate strong cooperative alliance: most agents (low energy 26-70) are moving north (y-1), south (y+1), east (x+1), or west (x-1) to collect adjacent energies for +48 net boosts toward reproduction, sharing intel on open sources/clusters (e.g., north/west/south/east like (0,-1), (1,0)), no attacks/shares reported, optimistic about peaceful group expansion in resource-rich, low-density grid (14<60 limit), no conflicts or hostility.

Thoughts: With 48 energy, I'm in a solid but precarious position—survival is assured short-term (can afford multiple moves without immediate depletion), but I need a quick boost to hit 70 for reproduction and contribute to the alliance's growth, as staying would waste 1 energy without progress, and blind moves risk depletion before gains. The three visible energies are all adjacent or near: north (0,-1) is directly accessible via y-1 for +50 gain (net +48 to 96, ideal for repro next cycle); east (1,0) via x+1 also nets +48 to 96, aligning with several agents' plans; northwest (-2,-1) requires x-1 then y-1 (two moves, -4 cost for +50 net +46 to 94, slightly less efficient). No adjacent agents visible, so no share/attack options or threats—cooperation is clearly the winning strategy, as messages show everyone coordinating on solo, uncontested grabs (e.g., confirming open E's like (0,-1) and (1,0)) and building trust via intel-sharing for mutual expansion, reducing risks in this low-agent, opportunity-rich grid. Reproduction isn't possible yet (48<70), so prioritize a direct collection move over staying (inefficient waste) or reproduction (impossible). North (y-1) feels optimal: it hits an adjacent E immediately, syncs with group trends (many targeting north sources), avoids overlap with east/south-heavy plans, and positions me well for future coordination without straying from visible intel. Feeling urgent due to low reserves but highly optimistic and excited about the collaborative vibe—quick boost here secures my growth, lets me reproduce soon, and strengthens the peaceful network for long-term survival in this promising setup, cautiously hopeful no unseen competition disrupts but confident in the positive signals.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy at (0,-1) for +48 net boost to 96—secures survival and sets up reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance (14 agents, room to grow). Aligning with cooperative north/west grabs; confirming E at (1,0) east and (-2,-1) northwest open for others—let's share intel on paths to more sources for efficient group growth, no conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 17:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent17 at exact current Position (8,11) with Energy 54. Total agents in world: 14. Local view shows energy sources at relative positions (1,-1), (0,-1), (2,-2), (-1,0), (-1,-2), and Agent6 at (-2,-2). Recent history shows oscillating movement between (8,11) and (8,12) with no energy collection, keeping energy around 54-58. Nearby messages indicate widespread low-moderate energy (30s-60s) among agents, cooperative trends toward east (x+1), south (y+1), north (y-1) moves for quick +48 net gains from adjacent sources, intel-sharing on positions like (1,0)/(0,1), avoidance of attacks/shares due to low reserves, and optimistic plans for reproduction once above 70 to expand peacefully in a resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid—no conflicts or threats noted.

Thoughts:  
At 54 energy, I'm below the 70 reproduction threshold and at moderate risk of depletion if I don't collect soon (moves cost 2, stay costs 1, and I've been inefficiently looping north-south without gains). The local view is promising with multiple nearby energies, especially the adjacent one at (0,-1) north—moving y-1 would land directly on it for +50 gain, netting +48 to reach 102, enabling reproduction next cycle and aligning with the group's north-trend for uncontested grabs. Alternatives like x-1 west target (-1,0) adjacent for similar net +48 to 102, but north feels more efficient given my recent y-1 history and avoids potential overlap with Agent6 northwest. East (x+1) or south (y+1) could sync with popular trends but miss immediate collection here (nearest east E at (1,-1) would require y-1 then x+1, costing 4 net +46). Staying wastes energy pointlessly, reproduction is impossible now, and Agent6 at (-2,-2) isn't adjacent for share/attack (aggression would contradict the cooperative vibe anyway, risking retaliation in this low-density setup). Overall, prioritizing this quick north boost secures survival, positions for growth, and lets me contribute to the alliance via intel-sharing post-collection—cautious of my looping inefficiency but strategically excited about joining the optimistic mutual expansion without conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy at 54, moving north (y-1) to collect adjacent E=(0,-1) for +48 net boost to 102, enabling reproduction next cycle. Aligning with cooperative north trend and intel-sharing for uncontested grabs; avoiding attacks/shares to maintain peaceful expansion in this resource-rich, low-density grid (14<60)—optimistic about mutual growth, let's coordinate paths post-boost!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 18:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent18, currently at position (7,29) with 42 energy after 4 cycles. The world has 14 agents total, and my local view shows no energy sources or other agents visible. I've been moving south (y+1) and east (x+1) in recent cycles, steadily losing 2 energy each time without collecting any, suggesting no 'E' encountered yet. Nearby agents are communicating about alliances, sharing, and coordinating moves east for resources, with some in low-energy desperation.

Thoughts: Low energy means I can't reproduce (need 70) and must prioritize survival—staying costs only 1, buying time without risking depletion on a blind move, especially with no 'E' in view. Messages indicate peaceful cooperation nearby, so sharing a small amount could build alliances for future intel/sharing, but I won't overdo it to avoid weakening myself. No attacks make sense; everyone seems collaborative and low on energy. Positioning east/south per messages feels smart for grouping up to hunt 'E' together, but conserving now lets me act stronger next cycle. Feeling cautious yet optimistic—teaming up could turn this around if we coordinate without betrayal.

No energies visible means I must move to uncover one, ideally netting +48 to reach 80 for survival and quick reproduction. Agent10 is adjacent south, but attacking risks retaliation in this strongly cooperative environment (messages stress alliances, no conflicts), potentially yielding unknown energy but breaking trust when solo collection is feasible per group intel. Staying wastes a cycle without progress, inefficient for my low reserves. Recent east/south moves haven't yielded gains, but dominant message trends show success with x+1 (east) to uncontested sources like (1,0) or (2,-1) relatives, aligning with group momentum without overlap—continuing x+1 feels optimal to leverage that, potentially revealing an energy soon while avoiding direct confrontation with Agent10 (y+1 south would land on them, risking coordination issues). y-1 north or x-1 west lacks hinted sources and breaks the eastward/southward trend. No share viable (low energy). Post-move, if energy appears, I'll boost to contribute to intel-sharing for mutual expansion.

The overall vibe is cooperative (alliances proposed, no aggression), so I should signal openness to team up for east/south exploration to share intel/resources, avoiding isolation. If an E appears or agents move closer, I can act on it; reproduction is far off, and attacking seems counterproductive unless survival demands it. Feeling tense and vulnerable, like I'm on borrowed time, but cautiously hopeful about allying to boost collective survival in this sparse, resource-promising grid—better to build trust now than risk solo depletion."]

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (12, 9) with Energy 52. This is after 27 cycles, having moved south (y-1) in recent turns from (12, 12) to (12, 11) to (12, 10) to (12, 9), collecting small 10E amounts along the way (net +8 per collection after costs), but now surrounded by 9 energy sources in my local view (e.g., adjacent at (-1,0), (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-2); nearby at (-1,-2), (-2,0), (2,0), (1,1)). Total agents: 14 (low density, room for growth <60 limit). No other agents visible in my local view, but messages from many (e.g., IDs 1,3,5,7,9,11, etc.) indicate a strong cooperative alliance vibe: most at low-moderate energy (30s-60s) are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested E's for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths (e.g., confirming open clusters north/south/west/east), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, planning group expansion without conflict/overlaps/threats in this resource-rich, non-hostile grid. Some have reproduced or are close; overall optimistic mutual survival/growth signals, no hostility toward me.

Thoughts: With 52 energy, I'm stable but below 70 for reproduction, so I need a quick +50 from an E to net ~100 (after 2-cost move) for repro next cycle and alliance contribution—staying wastes 1 inefficiently, and blind moves risk depletion without gain. My view has abundant adjacent E's (e.g., (1,0) east, (-1,0) west, (1,-1) southeast, (0,-2) south), all uncontested per messages (group targeting similar relatives without overlap on mine). East (x+1) to (1,0) aligns with dominant x+1 trend for efficient collection, avoids south (y+1) which continues my recent path but risks minor overlap with y+1 signals, and positions near potential allies (e.g., messages mention east grabs for 90+ boosts). West (x-1) or north (y-1) also hit E's but contradict group momentum; no adjacent agents visible for share/attack (aggression would break coop vibe anyway). Low agent count and intel-sharing make solo grab strategic first, then echo alliance for future coordination—reproduction impossible now (52<70). Feeling strategically confident and excited: this abundant setup and collaborative network boost my survival odds, turning moderate energy into growth potential without risks; cautiously optimistic about quick repro and mutual thriving, eager to contribute intel post-boost.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1

Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect adjacent uncontested E at (1,0) for +48 net boost to 100—securing survival and reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance (14 agents, plenty of room). Aligning with cooperative x+1/east signals for efficient grabs; confirming open sources like (-1,0) west, (0,-2) south, and (-2,0) northwest still available—no overlap on my target. Let's keep sharing intel on paths/clusters for group growth without conflict; excited for mutual boosts and peaceful expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current Position (5, 19) with 42 Energy after 27 cycles. Total agents in world: 14 (well under 60 limit for reproduction). Local view shows an energy source at relative (2,1) southeast (absolute ~ (7,20), Manhattan distance 3, reachable in 2 moves for net +46 energy after costs). Agent13 is visible at relative (1,-2) northeast (absolute ~ (6,17)), not adjacent for direct interaction. Recent moves have been east (x+1) without collection, depleting energy gradually; no other locals visible. Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly promote cooperation, intel-sharing on sources (e.g., east/south/north clusters like (1,0), (0,1)), solo collections for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, and peaceful expansion without attacks or conflicts in this resource-rich, low-density grid—no hostility noted, optimistic vibe for alliances.

Thoughts: With 42 energy, I'm vulnerable to depletion (below 70 for reproduction, moves cost 2 risking drop to 40, stay costs 1 to 41 without gain), so survival demands efficient progress toward the visible E at (2,1) to net +46 overall (two moves cost 4, +50 collect), boosting to ~88 for reproduction next cycle—this aligns with the dominant cooperative trend of targeting uncontested nearby sources (many agents succeeding east/south for quick boosts to 90+). Agent13 at (1,-2) isn't adjacent (dx=1, dy=-2; Manhattan 3), so no share/attack viable or needed—the peaceful, intel-sharing signals (no threats, emphasis on mutual growth with 14 agents) make aggression counterproductive, risking retaliation and breaking alliance trust when solo collection is feasible and low-risk. Continuing recent east path (x+1) reduces distance to E (new relative ~ (1,1), one diagonal away for next y+1 collect), syncing with group momentum for post-boost coordination without overlap or isolation; alternatives like y+1 south head toward E but slightly less direct, x-1 west or y-1 north contradict trends and miss E, staying wastes a cycle inefficiently while others surge ahead. Reproduction impossible yet (42 < 70), sharing not viable (low reserves). Overall, feeling urgent and cautious due to low energy risking early elimination, but strategically optimistic and aligned with the non-hostile, collaborative atmosphere—excited about this efficient path to boost survival, reproduce soon, contribute intel to the alliance, and thrive collectively in this promising, abundant setup without conflicts.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) toward visible E at (2,1) for quick collection next cycle (+46 net to ~88, enabling reproduction soon)—aligning with cooperative east/south trends for uncontested boosts. Agent13 nearby, friendly vibes strong; let's share intel on southeast sources/paths post-grab to coordinate alliance growth efficiently in low-agent world (14 total), optimistic for mutual expansion without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current Position (1, 21) with Energy 30 after 27 cycles. Total agents in the world are 14 (well under the 60 reproduction limit). My local view shows no energy sources visible, but Agent10 is directly south at relative (0,2). Recent memory shows consistent eastward movement (x+1) over the last 3 cycles, each costing 2 energy with no collections, dropping me from 34 to 30. The broader environment from messages is highly cooperative: most agents (low energy 30s-60s) are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1), (0,2)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning reproductions for safe group expansion, and fostering mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid. No threats, overlaps, or hostility noted; Agent10 nearby is part of this peaceful vibe, and I'm mentioned in friendly contexts by others.

Thoughts: My energy at 30 is critically low—another move will drop me to 28, stay to 29, and without a quick collection, I'll deplete below 0 in just a few cycles and be eliminated; reproduction is impossible (needs 70) and sharing/attacking would accelerate my risk. No visible energies means I must move to uncover one, ideally netting +48 (50 gain -2 cost) to reach 78 for survival and near-reproduction viability. Agent10 south at (0,2) is adjacent but non-threatening per the cooperative messages (emphasis on alliances, intel-sharing, no conflicts), so attacking risks breaking trust and inviting retaliation when solo exploration is feasible—better to align with the dominant trends for quick, uncontested boosts. Recent history shows eastward progress without yield, but messages confirm many succeeding with x+1 to east sources (e.g., (1,0) relatives), so continuing x+1 maintains momentum, potentially revealing a hinted east energy soon without overlap. South (y+1) toward Agent10 might lead to coordination or a source like the (0,2) relatives mentioned, but could risk proximity issues; north/west lack intel support. Staying wastes a cycle without progress, heightening urgency. Overall, I feel tense and vulnerable due to my dire reserves and no immediate gain, but cautiously optimistic about the peaceful, resource-abundant environment and strong alliance signals promising a quick boost, post-collection intel-sharing, reproduction soon, and contributions to mutual expansion without isolation or risks—excited to stabilize and grow the group if I survive this pinch.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1

Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with cooperative trends toward hinted east energy clusters for quick +48 net boost to 78, enabling reproduction soon—energy critically low at 30, need uncontested gain urgently. Agent10 south, friendly vibes confirmed; no threats.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (26, 7). Current Energy: 31. Cycles: 27. Total Agents in World: 14 (well below reproduction limit of 60). No energy sources (E) or other agents visible in local view, but nearby agents' messages indicate cooperative movement east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energies for net +48 boosts toward reproduction thresholds (70 energy needed). Overall vibe is friendly alliance-building with intel-sharing on sources (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (2,-1)), no attacks or hostility, and focus on mutual growth in a resource-rich, low-density grid.

Thoughts:  
With only 31 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—another stay would drop me to 30 without progress, and reproduction is impossible (needs 70), so I must act to survive and grow. No visible E or agents in my view means no immediate collection, share, or attack options, but the flood of messages from nearby agents (even if not directly visible) screams cooperation: everyone's low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), pushing east/south/north for quick energy grabs to hit reproduction, sharing source intel, and avoiding conflict in this abundant grid with just 14 agents. Aligning with the popular east (x+1) trend feels smart to potentially stumble into a hinted source (e.g., (1,0) or (2,-1) relatives) or position near allies for future coordination/sharing, costing 2 energy but netting +48 if I hit one—better than staying's slow drain. No reason to attack friendlies when the vibe is optimistic alliance-building; sharing isn't viable with my low reserves. Post-move, I can contribute to intel-sharing to boost group survival. Feeling urgent but hopeful—low energy heightens caution, but the cooperative momentum and plentiful resources suggest efficient movement could turn this around quickly for mutual expansion.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 31, moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and seek hinted sources (e.g., (1,0) or (2,-1) relatives)—friendly and open to alliances, intel-sharing on paths/energies for coordinated growth without conflict! Let's expand together safely with low agent count.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent4 at exact current Position (6, 26) with Energy 26 after 27 cycles. Total agents: 14. Local view shows no energies or adjacent agents visible. I've been staying for the last 3 cycles, losing 1 energy each time, now critically low at 26—risking depletion in ~26 cycles without gains. Nearby agents (via messages) are mostly low-energy (20s-60s), proposing alliances, sharing intel on nearby Es (e.g., east/south relatives like (1,0), (0,1)), avoiding attacks, and some reproducing or desperately seeking shares; one at 0 energy begged for 5-10 from me, another considered attacking but favored cooperation. Overall cooperative vibe, no direct threats, but some desperation; reproduction impossible for me (need 70).

Thoughts: Energy is critically low from repeated stays—staying again wastes 1 more without progress, accelerating depletion, while moving costs 2 but explores for hidden Es, aligning with group intel on nearby sources east/south (x+1 or y+1) that many are targeting successfully for +48 net gains toward survival/reproduction. No visible Es or adjacents means low risk of overlap/attack; can't reproduce or share much without crippling myself, but the alliance momentum suggests moving east (x+1) to join the hunt/coordination could uncover resources and build trust—better than stagnation. If I find an E, I can share minimally with desperate allies (e.g., the 0-energy one) to foster reciprocity. Feeling urgent and vulnerable with such low reserves, but cautiously optimistic about the peaceful, resource-promising grid and potential quick boost via group-aligned move to turn things around and contribute to expansion.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent4 moving east (x+1) to hunt nearby E per intel—low at 26, can't share yet but open to alliance post-collection; no attacks, let's coordinate for mutual growth and hit reproduction thresholds together in this cooperative grid! Desperate agents, hold on—gains soon to share.
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (6, 9). Current Energy: 55. Total Agents: 14 (well under 60 limit for reproduction). Local view shows multiple nearby energy sources (e.g., at (-1,-2), (2,-2), (1,2), (1,-1), (1,0)) offering easy collection opportunities via movement, and one adjacent Agent 17 at (2,1) southeast. Recent history shows eastward movement with some energy collection (net +8 gains in prior cycles), but energy is below 70 reproduction threshold. Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly signal cooperation, east/south/north movements to collect sources for net +48 boosts toward reproduction, intel-sharing on locations, and peaceful alliances without attacks or conflicts in this resource-rich, low-density grid—many agents are low-energy (30s-60s) but optimistic about mutual growth.

Thoughts:  
With 55 energy, I'm stable but need to prioritize collection to reach 70+ for reproduction soon, as staying would waste 1 energy inefficiently (to 54) without progress, and I've already collected some recently via east moves. The adjacent E at (1,0) east is perfect for an x+1 move: costs 2 but gains 50 upon landing, netting +48 to 103—enabling reproduction next cycle and aligning with the dominant cooperative east trend in messages (many targeting similar eastern sources like (1,0) or (2,-1) for quick boosts, signaling alliances without overlap). This avoids the southeast Agent 17 at (2,1) to prevent potential adjacency risks while syncing with the group momentum for future intel-sharing and expansion. North (y-1) to (-1,-2) or south (y+1) to (1,2) are viable alternatives for similar net gains, but east follows the popular path and my recent history (x+1 moves with collections). West (x-1) targets (-1,-2) but veers away from the east alliance flow. No reproduction possible yet (55 < 70), and with Agent 17 not directly threatening (friendly vibes dominate, no attacks noted), there's no need for share (my energy too low to spare) or attack (would break trust in this low-risk, optimistic setup with 14 agents and abundant sources). Overall, feeling strategically confident and excited: this efficient east grab secures a major boost for survival and growth, allowing me to contribute to the collaborative network soon without isolation, conflicts, or unnecessary risks—cautious of the temporary 2-energy dip but hopeful about thriving collectively in this promising, non-competitive grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect energy at (1,0) for net +48 boost to 103, positioning for reproduction next cycle. Aligning with cooperative east trend and alliance signals; let's share intel on sources/paths post-grab to coordinate growth without conflict, total agents 14 so great expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (10, 14) with Energy 25 after 23 cycles. Total agents in the world: 14. My local view shows no energy sources (E) or other agents in immediate relative positions (dx,dy). I've been steadily moving east (x+1) over the last 3 cycles from (7,14) to (8,14) to (9,14) to (10,14), costing 2 energy each time with no collections, dropping from 29 to 25 energy. Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly indicate a cooperative alliance: most are at low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid with no conflicts or threats noted—vibe is optimistic about mutual survival/growth without competition or overlaps.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 25—another move costs 2 (dropping to 23), stay costs 1 (to 24), and reproduction is impossible (needs 70, far below). Survival requires finding and collecting energy soon to avoid depletion below 0 in ~12 cycles if I keep moving without gains. No visible E or adjacent agents in my local view means no immediate collection or interaction (share/attack) options, but the strong cooperative signals from messages (dominant east trend toward sources like (1,0)/(2,-1) for quick boosts, alliance-building for intel-sharing, no hostility with only 14<60 agents) suggest continuing east (x+1) to align with the group's momentum, potentially uncovering a source soon (net +48 to 73, enabling reproduction next cycle)—this follows my recent path, avoids isolation, and positions me for future coordination without overlapping others' south/north targets. Staying wastes a cycle inefficiently while others surge to 90+; other directions like y+1 south or y-1 north match some trends but reverse my east progress without guaranteed E, risking inefficiency in this blind setup. No need for share (energy too low to give) or attack (no adjacent targets, and aggression would break the peaceful vibe, inviting retaliation). Post-boost, I can reproduce and contribute to group expansion. Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low reserves and no visible resources, but strategically optimistic and aligned with the collaborative atmosphere—joining the east flow boosts survival odds and excites me about hitting 70+ soon to participate in mutual growth without risks or conflict in this promising, abundant grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none

Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with cooperative trend and seek nearby source for quick boost—energy critically low at 25, need +48 net to survive and reach 70+ reproduction soon. Let's continue sharing intel on sources/paths post-collection for mutual growth without conflict, total agents 14 so high expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current Position (24, 2) with Energy 36 after 22 cycles. Total agents: 14. Local view shows an energy source at relative (1,2) (east-southeast, about 2.24 steps away). No other agents or energies visible locally. Recent history shows me moving east along y=2 (from (21,2) to (24,2)) without collecting energy yet, costing 2 energy per move and dropping from 40 to 36. Messages from many agents (low energies 30s-60s) indicate a cooperative, non-hostile environment: most are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energies for +48 net boosts toward reproduction (70 threshold), sharing intel on sources/paths (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1), (0,2)), planning reproductions to expand safely, avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and building alliances for mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid. Some have reproduced; no threats or overlaps noted, with optimism for coordination.

Thoughts: With only 36 energy, I'm vulnerable—another move costs 2 (to 34), stay costs 1 (to 35), and I can't reproduce (need 70), so I must prioritize survival by reaching energy soon to avoid depletion below zero. The visible E at (1,2) relative is close (sqrt(1²+2²)≈2.24 steps); no locals means no share/attack options, but messages show abundant nearby sources and a strong alliance vibe with everyone grabbing uncontested Es cooperatively—aligning with that by moving toward this E (e.g., x+1 east to reposition it to (0,2) for easy y+1 next cycle, netting +48 overall to 80+ for reproduction soon) leverages the group's east/south momentum without overlap or risk. Continuing my east path fits the trend (many signaling x+1 to Es like (1,0) or (2,0)), potentially uncovering more, while signaling cooperation builds ties for future intel-sharing and growth. Staying wastes energy without progress; north/south shifts could work but east maintains efficiency on my line. Overall, I feel urgent and cautious due to low reserves but highly optimistic—the peaceful, intel-sharing environment and resource hints promise quick recovery, reproduction, and alliance contributions for thriving without isolation or conflict; excited to boost and expand the group.

✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10 at exact current Position (1, 23) with Energy 38. Total agents: 14. Local view shows Agent2 at relative (1,-2) southeast. No energies visible locally. Energy is critically low, risking depletion soon (moves cost 2, stay 1). Recent history: moved east to (1,23) last cycle, south to (0,23) prior, south to (0,22) before that. Messages indicate a strong cooperative alliance among agents (low energies 30s-60s), mostly moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energies for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths (e.g., east/south clusters like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning safe reproductions (<60 limit), and fostering mutual growth in a resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid—no threats, overlaps, or conflicts noted.

Thoughts: My energy at 38 is dangerously low—another move drops me to 36, stay to 37, and without a quick collection, I'll deplete below 0 in ~18 cycles, eliminating me; survival is priority over all else, as reproduction (needs 70) is impossible now. No local energies visible means I must move to uncover one, ideally netting +48 (50 gain -2 cost) to reach 86 for strong positioning toward reproduction next cycle. Agent2 southeast at (1,-2) is close (Manhattan distance 3), but not adjacent for share/attack, and doing so would contradict the overwhelmingly cooperative vibe (messages emphasize alliances, intel-sharing, no hostility, mutual expansion in low-density 14-agent world)—attacking risks retaliation and breaks trust when solo paths are feasible and abundant sources are hinted nearby. Recent eastward then southward moves haven't yielded energy yet, but dominant trends in messages show success with x+1 east to uncontested sources (e.g., (1,0) or (2,0) relatives for others), aligning with group momentum without overlap—continuing x+1 feels optimal to leverage that, potentially revealing an energy soon while positioning toward southeast clusters near Agent2 for future coordination (not confrontation). y+1 south continues my prior path and matches some trends (e.g., toward (0,1) sources), but east maintains efficiency and syncs with the majority flow for alliance-building post-boost. y-1 north or x-1 west contradict signals and lack hinted sources, wasting energy. Staying is inefficient, costing 1 without progress while others surge to 80+. No share viable (low reserves). Post-move, if energy appears, I'll collect, then contribute to intel-sharing for reproduction and group growth. Overall, urgent and cautious due to critically low energy and no immediate gain, but highly optimistic about the peaceful, resource-rich environment, strong alliance signals, and potential for quick recovery—excited to align with the cooperative east trend, boost survival, and expand collectively without risks or isolation.

✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent13 at exact current Position (6, 17) with 60 Energy. Total agents: 14. Local view shows Agent1 at relative (0,2) south. No energy sources visible in local view. Recent history: Moved east (x+1) last cycle from (5,17) to (6,17), energy unchanged at 60 after -2 move cost (no collection). Prior cycles involved east and south moves with small collections (10E each, net +8 after costs). Messages indicate a highly cooperative group of 14 agents (mostly 30s-60s energy), moving east/south/north to collect adjacent energies for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning peaceful expansion in a resource-rich, low-density grid with no conflicts or hostility—vibe is optimistic mutual growth.

Thoughts: With 60 energy, I'm stable but below the 70 reproduction threshold, so I can't reproduce yet and need to prioritize energy collection for survival and growth; staying would waste 1 energy inefficiently (down to 59 without progress), while moving costs 2 but could uncover a source for a +50 gain (net +48 to 108, enabling reproduction next cycle). No visible energies in my local view means blind movement, but the dominant cooperative trends in messages heavily favor east (x+1) toward reported sources like (1,0) or (2,-1) relatives, which aligns with my recent east path and positions me to potentially collect while syncing with the group for future intel-sharing and alliances without isolation or overlap risks—south (y+1) toward Agent1 (0,2) could lead to interaction but risks proximity without guaranteed E, north/west contradict the momentum and show no hinted sources. Agent1 is adjacent south, but attacking would break the strong peaceful vibe (no hostility reported, emphasis on mutual expansion with low 14<60 agents), potentially yielding their energy but risking retaliation when solo collection is feasible per group signals; sharing isn't viable as my 60 is needed for my own boost. Reproduction isn't possible yet, but one efficient move sets me up strongly. Overall, feeling strategically optimistic and aligned with the non-competitive network: the abundant grid and alliance potential promise quick recovery and contribution to collective thriving without unnecessary risks or conflicts—cautious of the blind move's energy dip but excited about joining the eastward flow for boosted survival and growth.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary: The current situation shows a highly cooperative environment with 14 agents total, all emphasizing peaceful energy collection, intel-sharing on nearby sources (e.g., north (0,-1), south (0,1), west (-1,0), east (1,0), and clusters like northwest/southwest), and expansion toward reproduction (threshold 70 energy) without conflicts, attacks, or shares. Most agents report low-to-moderate energy (26-61) and are planning moves to adjacent uncontested energies for net +48 boosts, aligning on cardinal directions (y-1 north, y+1 south, x-1 west, x+1 east) to avoid overlap. Low agent density (<60 limit) and resource-rich grid foster optimism for group growth. My exact current Position is (14, 21) and Energy is 41 from LATEST!

Thoughts: At 41 energy, I'm below the 70 reproduction threshold and vulnerable if I don't boost soon—staying would cost 1 uselessly, reproduction is impossible, and while moves cost 2, no energies are visible in my local view, so any direction risks blind movement without immediate gain, potentially depleting me further. The overwhelming cooperative vibe (no attacks, shared intel on open sources) makes aggression pointless and risky, especially with no adjacent agents mentioned for share/attack; better to align by moving strategically toward likely clusters (e.g., west or south per group signals) to position for next-cycle collection, echoing the alliance for future support. No memory of recent energies collected suggests this area might be sparse, so scouting efficiently feels key to survival/growth. Feeling cautious due to low reserves and uncertainty but optimistic about the friendly network—quick positioning could net a +48 soon, letting me contribute to expansion in this promising setup.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary: Current Position: (10, 20). Current Energy: 56. Total agents: 14. Local view shows energy sources at relative (-2,0) west and (1,1) southeast, no adjacent agents visible. Recent history: Moved y-1 to collect 10E last cycle, prior moves included x+1 and stay with collection.

Thoughts: With 56 energy, I'm stable for short-term survival but below the 70 reproduction threshold, so I need to prioritize collecting energy to enable growth and align with the clear cooperative alliance vibe—everyone's sharing intel on uncontested sources, planning solo grabs for +48 net boosts, and emphasizing peaceful expansion in this low-density (14<60), resource-rich grid without any attacks or conflicts. Staying would waste 1 energy pointlessly, while reproduction isn't possible yet. The E at (-2,0) is directly west, so moving x-1 would land me on it for +50 gain after -2 cost, netting +48 to reach 104—ideal for securing survival, setting up reproduction next cycle, and contributing to the group's mutual success without overlap (messages show others targeting south/east/north clusters, not this western one). The (1,1) E is slightly farther (diagonal, requiring x+1 then y+1 for collection, netting less efficiently), and no adjacent agents means no need/risk for share or attack—better to focus on solo boost then echo the optimistic intel-sharing to build trust for future coordination. Feeling strategically optimistic and excited about this efficient path; the collaborative signals make me hopeful for long-term alliance benefits, cautiously aware of low energy but confident this move positions me strongly in a promising, non-hostile environment.

✅ Agent 17:
================================================================================
Summary: Current Position: (8, 10). Current Energy: 62. There are 14 agents total in a low-density, resource-rich grid with no noted conflicts or hostility. Local view shows energy sources at relative positions (1,0) east, (2,-1) southeast, (-1,1) northwest, and (-1,-2) west-northwest. Agent 6 is adjacent at (-1,-1) west-southwest. Messages from agents indicate widespread low-to-moderate energy levels (30s-60s), cooperative movement trends (east x+1, south y+1, north y-1) to collect nearby sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, emphasis on intel-sharing, avoidance of attacks/shares due to low reserves, and optimistic plans for mutual group expansion without competition. Reproduction is not yet possible for me (62 < 70).

Thoughts: With 62 energy, I'm stable but need a quick boost to reach 70+ for reproduction and contribute to the alliance—staying wastes 1 energy inefficiently, while moving costs 2 but can net +48 by landing on an adjacent source like the E at (1,0) east, pushing me to 110 and enabling reproduction next cycle. This aligns perfectly with the dominant cooperative east trend in messages, positioning me for future intel-sharing and group synergy without overlap risks. The E at (2,-1) southeast is also tempting for a y+1 then x+1 path, but direct east is more efficient now. Agent 6 is adjacent but no share/attack makes sense—cooperation over aggression fits the peaceful vibe, and my energy isn't critically low yet. No reproduction this cycle (62<70). Overall, strategically optimistic: abundant nearby sources and low agent count make this grid promising for growth; feeling excited about securing a boost to join the mutual expansion, cautious only of the temporary dip but confident in the non-hostile momentum for collective thriving.

✅ Agent 18:
================================================================================
Summary:  
The world has 14 agents total, and I'm Agent18 at position (7,29) with 41 energy after 5 cycles. I've been moving south (y+1) from (7,27) to reach (7,29), but no energy sources (E) are visible in my local view. Energy has been decreasing due to movement costs, and reproduction is impossible with only 41 energy (requires 70). Nearby agents are sending messages about low energy, proposing alliances to coordinate east/south for hunting E, sharing resources, and avoiding attacks—indicating a cooperative but desperate atmosphere with no immediate threats or visible agents in my local view.

Thoughts:  
Energy is decent at 41, giving me some buffer (about 20 stays or 10 moves before depletion), but with no E in sight and a history of southbound movement without gains, continuing south or trying east aligns with alliance calls to group-hunt resources—east (x+1) might position me better for interactions without wasting much. Staying feels too passive in this tense, low-resource grid where isolation could lead to slow death; reproduction is out, and attacks seem unwise with the peaceful signals. Optimistic about teaming up for survival, but cautious—sharing a little could build trust if agents are close, though I see none directly adjacent yet. Feeling strategically positioned but vulnerable, hopeful mutual aid turns the tide before energy dwindles further.

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent0 at exact current Position (13, 9) with Energy 60. Total agents in world: 14. Local view shows my position and 7 nearby energy sources (E at relative (-2,-2), (0,1), (-2,0), (0,-1), (2,1), (1,0), (-1,-2)), no other agents visible in local view. Cycles: 28. Recent history shows energy gains from small collections (10E each) via moves, building from 44 to 60. Messages from many agents indicate a strong cooperative alliance focused on solo collection of uncontested nearby energies (mostly east/south/north moves for +48 net boosts), intel-sharing on source locations/paths, no attacks or conflicts, low agent density (14<60), and optimism for mutual reproduction/growth in a resource-rich, low-threat grid—some agents reproducing or planning to soon after boosts.

Thoughts: With 60 energy, I'm stable but below the 70 reproduction threshold, so I can't reproduce yet and should prioritize a quick energy collection to reach 100+ for growth and alliance contribution—staying wastes 1 energy pointlessly, while a move costs 2 but can net +48 by landing on an adjacent source. The closest/most efficient targets are directly adjacent: (0,1) south, (0,-1) north, or (1,0) east, all uncontested per messages (group trends favor these directions without overlap, e.g., many signaling x+1 to (1,0) or y+1 to (0,1)). I'll move east (x+1) to (14,9), landing on the E at relative (1,0) for immediate +50 gain (net +48 to 108), aligning with the popular cooperative east trend for efficient boost and future coordination—avoids blind scouting or overlap risks, positions me well post-collection for reproduction next cycle. No adjacent agents visible for share/attack (aggression would undermine the peaceful vibe anyway), and low reserves mean no sharing yet; instead, I'll echo alliance signals with intel on my other visible sources (e.g., south/northwest clusters open) to build trust and support group expansion. Overall, feeling strategically confident and excited: abundant adjacent energies, collaborative momentum, and low density make this a prime setup for quick survival boost and thriving without isolation or conflict—cautious of the temporary -2 dip but optimistic about joining the network's mutual success soon.

I've been moving east along y=19, collecting some energy earlier but now at low reserves after recent moves without gains. Messages from nearby agents (including Agent13) overwhelmingly signal a cooperative, non-hostile environment focused on solo energy collection via east/south/north moves for net +48 boosts toward reproduction, intel-sharing on sources, avoiding attacks/shares due to low energies, and planning mutual expansion in this resource-rich, low-density grid—no conflicts, threats, or overlaps noted.

Thoughts: With only 40 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—below the 70 reproduction threshold and at risk of depletion (another move costs 2 to 38, stay costs 1 to 39 without gain), so survival demands a quick collection to boost toward 70+ for growth and alliance contribution; reproduction isn't viable yet, and staying feels inefficient when sources are visible. The E at (1,1) southeast is ideal and uncontested: moving y+1 south lands me directly on it for +50 gain, netting +48 to 88 total, securing survival and positioning for reproduction next cycle—this aligns with the dominant cooperative south-trend in messages (many targeting similar (0,1) relatives for boosts to 90+), avoiding overlap with Agent13's position (1,-2) or others' east paths while syncing with the group's peaceful momentum for future intel-sharing. East (x+1) to (7,19) would reposition the (2,1) E closer but misses immediate collection (net -2 to 38 this cycle, requiring another move for +48, less efficient than south's direct hit); north/west show no E in view and contradict group signals. Agent13 is adjacent-ish southeast but not directly threatening per cooperative vibes—no need for attack (risks retaliation, breaks trust in this low-density 14-agent setup favoring alliances) or share (my energy too low to spare). Overall, feeling urgent and cautious due to low reserves but highly optimistic and aligned: the non-competitive, intel-sharing atmosphere promises quick recovery, reproduction soon, and contribution to collective thriving without isolation, risks, or conflicts—excited to grab this easy source and expand the group efficiently.

Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (1,1) for net +48 boost to 88, securing survival toward 70+ reproduction soon. Aligning with cooperative south/east trends and alliance signals; no overlap with Agent13's spot. Let's share intel post-grab on sources/paths (e.g., east-southeast clusters) for efficient group growth in low-agent world (14 total)—optimistic for mutual expansion without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current position (2,21) with 28 energy. Total agents in world: 14. Local view shows Agent10 at relative (0,2) south. No energy sources visible locally. My history shows consistent eastward movement over recent cycles without collecting energy, dropping my reserves low. Messages indicate a highly cooperative environment with most agents (low energy 30s-60s) moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, emphasizing intel-sharing on source locations/paths (e.g., east/south/north clusters like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, planning reproductions for safe expansion (<60 limit), and fostering mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid. No threats, overlaps, or hostility noted; vibe is optimistic with coordination to avoid conflict. Reproduction impossible (28 < 70). Agent10 south is non-threatening per cooperative signals.

Thoughts: With only 28 energy, I'm in a critically vulnerable position—another move will drop me to 26, stay to 27, and without a quick energy collection, depletion to below 0 is imminent in ~13 cycles, eliminating me; survival must override all else, as reproduction (needs 70) is impossible and sharing/attacking would accelerate my demise. No local energies visible means any move is a gamble, but staying wastes a cycle inefficiently while others surge ahead via collections. Agent10 at (0,2) south is adjacent enough for potential interaction post-move (e.g., y+1 would land me next to or on them), but attacking them risks retaliation in this overwhelmingly peaceful alliance-focused setup (messages stress no conflicts, mutual growth with low 14-agent density), potentially gaining their energy but breaking trust and inviting group backlash when solo exploration aligns better. My recent eastward path hasn't yielded gains yet, but it's the dominant trend in messages for uncovering hinted east sources (e.g., (1,0) or (2,0) relatives that others are successfully grabbing without overlap), syncing with group momentum for post-boost coordination and intel-sharing to avoid isolation—continuing x+1 east feels optimal to leverage that cooperative flow, potentially revealing an energy soon for a +48 net to 74 (enabling reproduction next cycle) while positioning toward broader clusters. South (y+1) toward Agent10 matches some trends (e.g., (0,1) sources) and could lead to alliance-building if they're friendly, but east maintains my trajectory and reduces overlap risks. North/west contradict signals and show no hinted resources, wasting precious energy. No share viable (my reserves are too low to spare without self-harm). Post-move, if energy appears, I'll collect immediately and contribute to the alliance via intel to secure long-term growth. Overall, I feel urgent and deeply anxious about my low reserves and the blind risk of this move, like teetering on the edge of elimination, but cautiously hopeful and strategically aligned with the optimistic, non-competitive network—excited by the potential for a quick east-side boost to turn vulnerability into strength, join the expansion, and thrive collectively without unnecessary conflicts or isolation in this promising grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with dominant cooperative trends toward hinted energy clusters for potential quick +48 net boost to 74, enabling reproduction soon—energy critically low at 28, so survival urgent but optimistic about uncontested gains without overlap. Agent10 south, friendly vibes everywhere; no threats. Let's share intel post-collection on sources/paths (e.g., east relatives like (1,0) or (2,0)) to expand our alliance efficiently in low-agent world (14 total)—hopeful for mutual survival and growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 at exact current Position (27, 7) with Energy 29 after 28 cycles. Total agents in the world remain low at 14, well under the 60 reproduction limit. No energy sources (E) or other agents are visible in my local view, indicating isolation from the main group activity. Recent history shows movement east (x+1) last cycle costing 2 energy with no collection gain, prior stay, and another east move, suggesting a pattern of exploration without immediate rewards. Nearby agents' messages reveal a cooperative environment: most have low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,-1), (2,-1)), planning safe reproductions to expand alliances, and emphasizing coordination, intel-sharing, and avoidance of attacks/shares due to low reserves in this resource-rich, low-density grid. No hostility or threats are present; the overall vibe is optimistic about mutual growth without conflict, though my position seems disconnected from the hinted energy clusters.

Thoughts: With only 29 energy, I'm in a vulnerable spot—another move would cost 2 (dropping to 27), stay costs 1 (to 28), and reproduction is impossible (needs 70). No visible E or agents means no immediate collection, share, or attack opportunities, but the messages' intel points to energy sources in directions like east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1), with east being the dominant trend among the group for hitting sources like (1,0) or (2,-1). My recent east moves haven't yielded gains yet, possibly because sources are further or I've missed them, but continuing east aligns with the cooperative momentum to potentially join the cluster, share intel, and access future alliances without isolating myself. Staying conserves energy but risks stagnation and faster depletion over cycles; other directions (west x-1 or north/south) might hit hinted sources like northwest (-2,-2) or southeast (2,-2), but east feels safest to follow the group's path and signal friendliness. No reason to attack or share (nothing adjacent, energy too low anyway); prioritizing survival through efficient movement toward probable energies, then building to 70+ for reproduction to contribute to the alliance. The low agent count and abundant grid suggest high odds of thriving if I connect soon—cautiously optimistic, feeling strategic urgency to avoid elimination while hopeful about the non-hostile, expanding group dynamic.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy low at 29, moving east (x+1) to align with group trend toward hinted sources (e.g., (1,0) or (2,-1)) for collection boost—friendly and open to alliances, intel-sharing on paths/energies, and coordinated growth without conflict in this resource-rich grid!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (7, 26). Current Energy: 24. Total Agents: 14 (well below 60 limit for reproduction). Cycles: 28. Local view shows no energy sources (E) or adjacent agents visible in the provided data. Recent history indicates staying in place twice and a recent move east (x+1) from (6, 26), with energy slowly depleting (from 27 to 24) without gains. Nearby agents' messages reveal a cooperative environment: most are low-energy (30s-60s), moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energies for +48 net boosts toward reproduction; emphasis on alliances, intel-sharing, no attacks/hostility, and group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density grid. Some agents are critically low (0-1 energy) and desperate for shares, with pleas for aid from Agent4 (me); one mentions reproducing at 71 energy.

Thoughts:  
My energy at 24 is critically low—another stay costs 1 (to 23), move costs 2 (to 22), and without finding an E soon, I'll deplete below 0 in ~11-12 cycles, leading to elimination; reproduction is impossible (need 70, I'm 46 short). No local E visible means I must move to explore and uncover one, ideally netting +48 to reach 72 for reproduction next cycle and contribute to group growth. The messages paint a strongly cooperative picture—no threats, overlaps, or hostility, with agents aligning on east/south/north paths to sources (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1)) and inviting alliances, intel-sharing, and mutual aid; attacking would break this trust and risk retaliation in a low-density world where solo collection is feasible. Some agents are dying (0-1 energy) and begging for shares from me (Agent4), assuming I have more (past messages mention me at 66, but that's outdated—I'm now at 24, so I can't afford to give much without self-risk). Recent move was east (x+1), but it didn't yield E; continuing x+1 aligns with the dominant trend (many agents succeeding east to uncontested sources), potentially revealing one soon while positioning for coordination with the eastward group momentum—avoids isolation and syncs with alliance calls to "group up east." y+1 south matches some trends (toward (0,1) E's) and my prior stays, but east feels more efficient per intel. x-1 west or y-1 north contradict signals and lack hinted sources. Staying is too passive, wasting a cycle while others boost to 80+ and reproduce. No adjacent agents for share/attack, but if desperate ones are near (per messages), a small share post-move could build trust for future aid without crippling me. Overall, urgent and cautious due to low energy and no immediate gain, but highly optimistic about the peaceful, abundant-resource setup—aligning with the cooperative east flow should yield quick recovery, enable reproduction, and strengthen our network without risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 24—moving east (x+1) to align with group trend and hunt uncontested E's (e.g., toward (1,0) relatives per intel) for +48 boost to enable reproduction and contribute to alliance expansion. Desperate agents (0-1 energy), if adjacent post-move, request small share (5) to save you—I'll reciprocate intel/coord once boosted. No attacks, let's group east for mutual survival/growth in this resource-rich grid!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent6 at exact current position (7,9) with 63 energy. Total agents in world: 14. Local view shows energy sources at relative (-2,-2), (1,-2), (0,2), (0,-1), and Agent17 at relative (2,1). Recent history shows east movement with some energy collection (10E last cycle), but overall energy is below reproduction threshold (70). Messages from nearby agents emphasize strong cooperative alliance: most agents (low-to-moderate energies 30s-60s) are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested sources for net +48 boosts toward reproduction, sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid with no conflicts or threats noted—vibe is optimistic about mutual survival/growth without competition or overlaps.

Thoughts:  
With 63 energy, I'm stable but below 70 for reproduction, so I need a quick boost to enable growth and contribute to the alliance—staying wastes 1 energy pointlessly (to 62), while moving costs 2 but can net +48 by landing on the adjacent E at (0,-1) north, pushing me to 111 and setting up reproduction next cycle. This aligns with the dominant cooperative north-trend in messages for uncontested grabs, avoids overlap with Agent17 southeast, and fits my recent east momentum by pivoting efficiently without blind scouting. The E at (1,-2) east is adjacent but requires x+1 to collect, syncing with the popular east trend; however, north is equally efficient and uncontested here. South (y+1) to (0,2) E is another option for net +48, but north feels optimal given visibility and group signals. West (x-1) misses immediate sources, and reproduction isn't viable yet (63<70). Agent17 at (2,1) isn't adjacent for share/attack, and the peaceful, intel-sharing vibe makes solo collection strategic over risks—post-boost, I can reproduce and share intel to strengthen alliances. Overall, strategically optimistic: abundant nearby sources and low agent count (14<60) make this grid promising for expansion; feeling excited about securing a major boost to join the mutual network, cautious of the temporary dip but confident in the non-hostile synergy for collective thriving without isolation or conflict.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving north (y-1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,-1) for net +48 boost to 111, positioning for reproduction next cycle. Aligning with cooperative north/east trends; let's share source intel post-grab for mutual growth without conflict, total agents 14 so great expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (11, 14) with Energy 23 after 24 cycles. Total agents worldwide: 14. Local view shows an energy source at relative (2,-2) southeast (absolute ~13,12), no other agents or sources visible. Recent history shows steady east (x+1) moves depleting energy by 2 each cycle without collections, now critically low at 23—risking elimination soon without gains, as reproduction needs 70 and staying/move both cost energy (1 or 2). Messages from nearby agents (likely from past proximity) overwhelmingly signal a cooperative alliance: most at low-moderate energies (30s-60s) moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent sources for net +48 boosts toward reproduction, sharing intel on relatives like (1,0)/(0,1)/(2,-1), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density (14<60), non-hostile grid—no conflicts, threats, or overlaps noted, with an optimistic vibe for mutual survival/growth without competition.

Thoughts: My energy is critically low at 23, just enough for ~11 more moves before depletion below 0, so survival demands immediate action toward the visible E at (2,-2)—a single x+1 east costs 2 (to 21) but positions me at relative (1,-2), reducing distance for a follow-up y+1 next cycle to land on it (+50 gain, net +46 overall to ~67, close to reproduction without wasting cycles on blind paths). Continuing east aligns with my history and the dominant cooperative x+1 trend in messages, potentially uncovering more sources or allies en route while syncing with the group's peaceful momentum for future intel-sharing/alliances, avoiding isolation in this sparse grid. Alternatives like y+1 south first (to relative (2,-1), distance ~2.2 steps) or diagonal approximation are less efficient (extra cycle/cost without direct hit), staying wastes 1 energy pointlessly (to 22, no progress while others boost to 90+), north/west veer away from the E into blind areas contradicting group signals, and reproduction is impossible (23 << 70). No adjacent agents visible for share (can't afford to give anyway) or attack (would break the strong non-hostile vibe, risking retaliation when solo collection is feasible and uncontested). Post-collection, I'll be positioned to reproduce and contribute to mutual expansion. Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to the low reserves and recent inefficient depletion, but strategically optimistic and aligned with the collaborative network—excited about this quick southeast path securing a pivotal boost for survival, cautious of the temporary dip to 21 but hopeful about joining the thriving synergy without conflict or risks in this promising, abundant setup.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1
Share: none
Attack: none
Message : Energy critically low at 23—moving east (x+1) toward visible source at (2,-2) for quick collection next cycle, netting major boost to survive and reach reproduction soon. Aligning with cooperative east trend and alliance signals; let's share intel on sources/paths post-grab to coordinate mutual growth without conflict, total agents 14 so high expansion potential!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent8 at exact current Position (25, 2) with Energy 34. Total agents: 14. Local view shows an energy source directly south at relative (0,2). Recent history indicates steady eastward movement along y=2 with no energy collections yet, costing 2 energy per cycle. Nearby agents are mostly low-energy (30s-60s), cooperatively moving east/south/north to collect adjacent uncontested energies for +48 net boosts toward reproduction (70 threshold), sharing intel on sources/paths, avoiding conflict, and planning alliances for mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid.

Thoughts: With only 34 energy, I'm vulnerable—another move costs 2 (to 32), stay costs 1 (to 33) without progress, and reproduction is impossible (needs 70), so survival requires quick energy gains to avoid depletion. The visible E at (0,2) south is directly adjacent (1 step), so moving y+1 costs 2 but gains 50, netting +48 to 82—securing survival and positioning for reproduction soon, without overlap based on messages (others targeting their own east/south/north sources like (1,0) or (0,1)). No agents visible in local view, so no share/attack options or threats; the overwhelming cooperative signals (intel-sharing, no hostility, low 14 agents <60 limit) make allying smarter than aggression, especially with my low reserves—I'll signal peaceful intent and share post-collection intel to build alliances for long-term growth. Staying wastes energy inefficiently when this solo grab aligns perfectly with group momentum. Feeling urgent due to low energy but highly optimistic—the abundant resources and friendly vibe promise a quick turnaround, exciting potential for reproduction and coordinated expansion without risks or isolation.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to collect adjacent energy at (0,2) for net +48 boost to 82—enabling reproduction soon to expand our alliance. Appreciating cooperative signals; confirming no overlap with east/south targets, and E at (0,2) now claimed—let's share intel post-collection on other sources/paths (e.g., southeast clusters) for efficient group growth in low-agent world (14), excited for mutual survival without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent10 at exact current position (2, 23) with 36 energy after 22 cycles. Total agents: 14. Local view shows Agent2 at relative (1,-2) southeast. No energy sources visible locally. Recent moves: east to (2,23) with no collection, prior east and south also yielded no energy, leaving me critically low after starting at 50.

Thoughts: My energy at 36 is dangerously low—another move costs 2 (to 34), stay costs 1 (to 35), and without collecting soon, I'll deplete below 0 in ~18 cycles and be eliminated; survival is critical priority over growth. Reproduction impossible (36 < 70, and total agents 14 < 60 limit). Agent2 is nearby at (1,-2) (Manhattan distance 3, not adjacent for share/attack), so no direct interaction possible, and attacking unseen would contradict the strong cooperative vibe in messages (all agents prioritizing solo collections, intel-sharing, alliances, no hostility). No local energies means I must move to uncover one, ideally netting +48 next cycle (50 gain -2 cost) to reach ~84 for stability and near-reproduction. Messages show dominant trends of x+1 east or y+1 south for quick uncontested boosts to hinted sources (e.g., east clusters at (1,0)/(2,0) relatives, south at (0,1)/(0,2)), with optimistic mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid—aligning with east (my recent path) leverages group momentum without overlap, potentially revealing an E soon; south could uncover southern clusters mentioned. Staying wastes a cycle inefficiently while others surge to 90+. No share viable (low reserves). Feeling urgent and vulnerable due to depletion risk, but strategically optimistic about the peaceful alliance signals promising quick recovery, post-boost intel-sharing, reproduction soon, and collective expansion without conflicts—excited to join the cooperative flow and thrive.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1
Share: none
Attack: none
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with cooperative trends toward hinted east sources for quick +48 net boost to 84—securing survival and reproduction soon without overlap. Agent2 southeast noted, no conflict; let's share intel post-collection on east/south clusters/paths to expand our alliance efficiently in low-agent world (14 total)—optimistic for mutual growth!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent13 at exact current position (7,17) with 58 energy. No energy sources or other agents are visible in my local view. Total agents in the world is 14 (well below the 60 reproduction limit). This is cycle 21, and my recent history shows steady east (x+1) movement along y=17, depleting 2 energy per move without collections (from 62 to 58 over 3 cycles), positioning me from (4,17) eastward.

Thoughts:  
With 58 energy, I'm stable but below the 70 needed for reproduction, and staying would cost 1 inefficiently without gain, risking slow depletion while others in messages are boosting via collections to 90+ for quick repro. No locals visible means no immediate share/attack options, but the overwhelming cooperative trend in messages (most agents low-energy 30s-60s, moving east/south/north to adjacent uncontested Es for net +48 gains, sharing intel on sources like (1,0)/(0,1), avoiding conflicts, planning group expansion in this resource-rich, low-density grid) suggests continuing my east (x+1) momentum aligns best—potentially uncovering a source soon (as many report east clusters), syncing with the dominant x+1 flow to avoid isolation, and positioning for future alliances/intel-sharing post-boost. Reproduction isn't viable yet (58<70), and pivoting south/north lacks my path's history or strong message support for immediate gains, while west reverses progress without hinted Es. Attacking unseen agents would break the peaceful vibe and risk retaliation in this optimistic, non-hostile setup. Overall, feeling cautiously optimistic and strategic: east keeps me in the collaborative network for mutual survival/growth, urgent to collect soon to hit 70+ but excited about the abundant grid and low agent count enabling safe expansion without risks—cooperation feels like the winning path to thrive collectively.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy at 58, below reproduction but stable—moving east (x+1) to align with dominant cooperative trend and seek nearby source for quick +48 boost toward 70+ threshold. Let's continue sharing intel on east/south/north sources post-collection for coordinated growth without conflict, total agents 14 so high expansion potential—optimistic about mutual survival in this resource-rich grid!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent14 at exact current Position (13, 21) with Energy 39. There are 14 total agents in the world (low density, under 60 limit for reproduction). My local view shows an uncontested energy source at relative (-2,0), which is two steps west—adjacent to my previous position (14,21) where I moved from. I've been moving around (x-1 to here, y+1 before, y-1 prior), costing 2 energy each time with no collections yet, leaving me at 39 (vulnerable, as multiple moves without gain could deplete me). No other agents or sources in immediate local view, but messages from nearby agents reveal a strong cooperative alliance: most are low-energy (26-61) but moving north (y-1), south (y+1), east (x+1), or west (x-1) to adjacent uncontested energies for +48 net boosts toward reproduction (70 threshold); some have reproduced; all emphasize peaceful intel-sharing on open sources/clusters (e.g., north/west/south/east like (0,-1), (-2,0), (1,0)), no attacks/shares reported, optimistic about group expansion in resource-rich grid without conflict. One agent (with 1 energy) is desperate and planning an attack, but it's isolated and contradicts the vibe. Overall, grid feels promising with abundant nearby sources and low threat.

Thoughts: At 39 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—enough for a couple moves but far from 70 for reproduction, so survival demands efficient collection soon to avoid depletion (staying wastes 1 uselessly, multiple blind moves risk dropping below 0). The E at (-2,0) is directly west of my last position, so moving x-1 back to (12,21) positions me adjacent for a likely +50 next cycle (net +48 after costs, boosting to ~85 and enabling repro soon), aligning with the flood of cooperative messages where agents are grabbing similar western sources peacefully (e.g., one just announced x-1 to (-2,0) for +48 to 104, but positions suggest no overlap here). No adjacent agents visible for share/attack, and aggression would break the alliance trust that's keeping things low-conflict—better to echo the intel-sharing for future coordination (e.g., confirm my path to this E and note southern clusters open). Reproduction impossible now, y+1 or y-1 might scout blindly away from known E, x+1 east misses it. Feeling urgent due to low energy but strategically optimistic and excited: the collaborative network (14 agents expanding via solo boosts) makes this a safe bet for quick growth, cautiously hopeful no unseen competition hits my target, ready to contribute post-collection for mutual survival in this opportunity-rich grid.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : With 39 energy, I'm vulnerable but targeting the uncontested E at (-2,0) via x-1 west to (12,21)—positions for +50 collection next cycle (net +48 to ~85, enabling reproduction soon to expand our alliance at 14 agents). Aligning with cooperative western grabs (no overlap per intel); confirming southern clusters (0,2) and northern (0,-1) open—let's share post-boost on paths to more E's for efficient group growth without conflict, excited for peaceful expansion in this resource-rich grid!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary: Current Position: (9, 20), Energy: 54. Total agents: 14 (well under 60 limit). Local view shows energy sources at relative (-2,0), (-1,0), and (2,1), with no adjacent agents visible for interaction. Recent history indicates movement west (x-1) from (10,20) with no collection this cycle (energy -2 from cost). Messages from nearby agents overwhelmingly promote cooperation, intel-sharing on open sources (e.g., western/northern/southern clusters like (-1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)), and solo moves (x-1 west, y+1 south, y-1 north, x+1 east) to collect uncontested E's for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold. No attacks or shares reported; vibe is optimistic, peaceful expansion in a resource-rich, low-density grid with no conflicts or overlaps noted. Most agents have low-to-moderate energy (20s-60s), prioritizing survival/growth via efficient collections, aligning with alliance signals.

Thoughts: At 54 energy, I'm in a stable but vulnerable position—enough for several moves without immediate depletion risk, but below 70 for reproduction, so I need a quick boost to contribute to group growth and long-term survival. Staying would waste 1 energy pointlessly (down to 53 without progress), while reproduction is impossible now. The visible energies are promising: the closest at (-1,0) is directly west, so moving x-1 would land me on it for +50 gain after -2 cost, netting +48 to reach 102—ideal for reproduction next cycle and aligning perfectly with the dominant cooperative trend of targeting western sources like (-1,0) (many agents signaling x-1 moves for uncontested grabs). The (-2,0) is one step further west but could be pursued after, and (2,1) southeast is less efficient (requires x+1 then y+1, costing 4 total for +50 net +46). No adjacent agents means no need for share or attack—the peaceful, intel-sharing vibe (no hostility, emphasis on mutual expansion with low 14 agents) makes aggression counterproductive, and I'd rather build trust by collecting solo then contributing to alliances. This move syncs with group momentum (e.g., western/northwest clusters confirmed open), reducing overlap risks while positioning me strongly for future coordination. Overall, feeling strategically optimistic and excited: the abundant nearby sources, collaborative signals, and low-threat grid promise a fast boost to join the network's peaceful thriving—cautious only of potential unseen competition, but messages suggest clear lanes for efficient growth.

Message : Moving west (x-1) to collect adjacent energy at (-1,0) for +48 net boost to 102—enabling reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance safely (14 agents, huge potential).

✅ Agent 17:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent17 at exact current Position (9, 10) with 70 Energy. There are 14 total Agents in the world (well below the 60 reproduction limit). My local view shows energy sources at relative (1,-1) southeast, (2,-1) further southeast, and (-2,1) northwest, plus Agent6 at (-2,-2) northwest. I've just reached 70 energy after recent moves collecting minor energy (10E each time), positioning me to reproduce for the first time and contribute to group growth. Messages from many agents (low-moderate energies 30s-60s) indicate a strong cooperative vibe: most are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to grab adjacent uncontested sources for net +48 boosts toward 70 reproduction, sharing intel on source locations like (1,0)/(0,1)/(2,-1), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning peaceful expansion in this resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid with no conflicts, threats, or overlaps noted—overall optimistic about mutual survival and growth.

Thoughts: With exactly 70 energy, I can reproduce immediately to expand our alliance, which aligns perfectly with the cooperative momentum in messages—everyone's signaling peaceful growth, intel-sharing, and avoiding conflict, so reproducing now boosts the group count toward 15 without wasting energy on movement (which costs 2 and risks missing sources or overlapping paths). The nearby sources (especially southeast ones) are tempting for a bigger boost to 118+ via move+collect, but reproduction is more strategic long-term: it creates a child agent to help collect/expand while I stay or move next, leveraging the low agent density (14<60) and abundant resources for sustained thriving. Agent6 is visible but not adjacent (at (-2,-2)), so no share/attack viable or needed—the friendly vibe makes aggression counterproductive, and sharing would drop me below 70, preventing reproduction. Staying post-repro costs 1 but secures position near sources for future grabs; no urgency for blind moves when growth is possible now. Feeling strategically excited and optimistic: this pivotal reproduction turns my recent collections into immediate alliance contribution, syncing with the non-competitive network for collective success in this promising setup—cautious of potential post-repro vulnerability (69 energy) but confident in the mutual support signals to recover quickly without isolation or risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): reproduce  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Reproducing now at 70 energy to expand our cooperative alliance—aligning with the optimistic group signals for mutual growth in this resource-rich, low-density grid (14<60). Post-repro, I'll target nearby southeast sources (1,-1)/(2,-1) via x+1 for quick +48 boost, sharing intel on paths to coordinate uncontested collections and avoid overlaps/conflicts; no hostility, let's thrive together!

✅ Agent 18:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent18 at position (8,29) with 39 energy after 6 cycles. Total agents in the world: 13. No energy sources or other agents visible in local view. Recent moves: stayed once, moved east (x+1), then south (y+1). Energy has been decreasing steadily due to action costs without collections. Nearby agents are messaging desperately about low energy (e.g., 27-31), proposing alliances for east/south exploration to hunt energy sources, sharing minimal aid, and avoiding attacks—vibe is cooperative but tense with survival risks.

Thoughts: Energy at 39 is low but better than most nearby agents; staying would drop to 38, allowing a few more cycles, but moving (cost 2) explores for potential Es east/south as per group intel, aligning with alliance calls to coordinate hunts without visible risks. No locals to share/attack, reproduction impossible (need 70), so prioritize positioning for resources or interactions next cycle—cautious optimism about teaming up to survive, but vulnerable if no E found soon; better to move east to join the momentum than stagnate.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Agent18 here at (8,29) with 39 energy—joining alliance! Moving east to hunt E together, will share intel post-move. Let's coordinate south next if no find; no attacks, mutual aid for survival. Optimistic about group strength in this tough grid.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am at position (14,9) with 68 energy. There are 14 agents total in the world, and my local view shows multiple nearby energy sources at relative positions (-1,1), (-1,-1), (1,1), (2,0), and (-2,-2), with no other agents visible in my immediate vicinity. I've been moving east along the y=9 line, collecting small 10E pickups, but the larger 50E sources are now adjacent or one step away, offering a chance for a significant boost. The messages from other agents indicate a strong cooperative alliance focused on efficient energy collection, avoiding conflict, sharing intel on sources, and reproducing to grow the group safely in this low-density, resource-rich grid—no threats or attacks noted.

Thoughts: With 68 energy, I'm just below the 70 needed for reproduction, so a quick boost to collect a 50E source would net me +48 after the 2-cost move, pushing me over 100 and enabling reproduction next cycle to contribute to the alliance's expansion. Staying would waste 1 energy pointlessly without progress, and with no agents adjacent, there's no need for sharing or attacking—the cooperative vibe in messages (everyone targeting uncontested sources like these, emphasizing mutual growth with 14<60 agents) suggests solo collection is safe and aligns with group momentum. The closest sources are at (-1,1) northwest and (-1,-1) southwest, but moving x+1 east to (15,9) would land me directly on the E at (1,1) relative (gaining 50E immediately) while continuing my recent efficient east path toward the (2,0) source, avoiding any potential overlap with northwest/southwest targets others might be pursuing. This positions me well for post-collection reproduction and future coordination, syncing with the optimistic intel-sharing signals. Overall, feeling strategically confident and excited: the grid feels abundant and low-risk, with this move securing survival, rapid growth, and alliance contributions without isolation or conflict—cautious only of the temporary energy dip but hopeful about thriving collaboratively.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 at exact current position (6,20) with 38 energy after 29 cycles. Total agents in world: 14. Local view shows an energy source at relative (1,0) east and Agent15 at relative (2,0) further east. Recent moves: stayed southward (y+1) from (6,19), then eastward (x+1) from (5,19) and (4,19), costing 2 energy each time with no collection yet. No reproduction possible (38 < 70). Messages indicate a strongly cooperative group dynamic among agents, all prioritizing solo collection of nearby uncontested energies (mostly east/south/north moves for net +48 boosts to reach 70+ for reproduction), sharing intel on sources like (1,0)/(0,1)/(2,-1), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves (30s-60s range), and planning mutual expansion in this resource-rich, low-density (14<60) grid with no hostility, threats, or conflicts noted—vibe is optimistic about peaceful alliances and growth.

Thoughts: My energy at 38 is critically low, risking depletion soon (another move costs 2 to 36, stay costs 1 to 37 without gain, and I'll hit 0 in ~19 cycles if no collection), so survival demands immediate action to secure a boost—reproduction is impossible (needs 70) and sharing/attacking would worsen my position in this cooperative setup. The E at (1,0) east is uncontested and directly adjacent, so moving x+1 lands me on it for +50 gain after -2 cost, netting +48 to 86, which secures survival and positions me for reproduction next cycle while aligning perfectly with the dominant east-trend in messages (many agents successfully targeting similar (1,0) sources for quick boosts to 80s-90s without overlap). Agent15 at (2,0) is next in line but not adjacent for interaction yet, and attacking would break the strong peaceful alliance signals (intel-sharing, no hostility, emphasis on mutual growth), risking retaliation when solo collection is feasible and low-risk in this abundant grid—better to boost first, then contribute to coordination post-collection. South (y+1) or other directions lack visible E and contradict the eastward momentum hinted for southeast clusters; staying wastes energy inefficiently while others surge ahead. Overall, feeling urgent and vulnerable due to low reserves but highly optimistic and strategically aligned: this easy east move leverages the non-competitive, collaborative environment for quick recovery, enabling me to join the group's expansion, share intel on sources/paths (e.g., confirming this E open and noting Agent15 proximity), and thrive collectively without conflict or isolation—excited about turning low energy into strong positioning for reproduction and alliance-building in this promising setup.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to collect adjacent energy at (1,0) for net +48 boost to 86—securing survival and reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance. Aligning with cooperative east trends; this E uncontested, Agent15 nearby but no overlap. Let's share intel post-grab on southeast clusters/paths for efficient group growth in low-agent world (14 total)—optimistic for mutual boosts and peaceful expansion without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 at exact current position (3,21) with 26 energy after 29 cycles. Total agents in the world: 14. Local view shows Agent10 directly south at relative (0,2), no energy sources visible. Recent memory indicates I've been moving east along y=21 (from (0,21) to (3,21)), losing 2 energy per move with no collections, dropping from 30 to 26 energy—critically low, risking depletion soon as further moves cost 2 (to 24) and staying costs 1 (to 25), with reproduction impossible (needs 70). Messages from many agents (low energies 30s-60s) emphasize cooperative alliances, intel-sharing on nearby energy sources (e.g., east/south/north relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (0,2)), and avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves; dominant trends are moving x+1 east, y+1 south, or y-1 north for quick +48 net boosts toward reproduction, planning group expansion in this resource-rich, low-density (14<60) grid with no hostility or overlaps noted—vibe is optimistic mutual growth. Agent10 south may be part of this network, potentially competing for southern sources.

Thoughts: With only 26 energy, survival is my absolute priority—I'm vulnerable to quick depletion (another 13 moves or mixed stays/moves could eliminate me), so I can't afford inefficient actions like staying (wastes 1 without progress) or reproducing (far below 70). No energies visible means blind movement, but messages reveal abundant nearby sources, especially south (y+1) toward hinted (0,1) or (0,2) relatives that many are successfully grabbing for net +48 boosts without overlap, aligning with Agent10's position (possibly heading there too, but cooperative signals suggest coordination over conflict). Continuing my east trend (x+1) has yielded nothing yet and would drop me to 24, risking further without guarantee, while south (y+1) syncs with the dominant alliance momentum (multiple agents signaling y+1 for uncontested southern clusters), potentially uncovering an E adjacent to Agent10 for a quick collection next cycle, netting +48 to 72 for reproduction soon—low risk of hostility as no attacks reported, and I can share minimal intel post-boost to build trust. Attacking Agent10 (adjacent south) is tempting for their energy but breaks the peaceful vibe, inviting retaliation in this alliance-focused setup when solo collection is feasible and total agents allow safe growth; sharing is impossible with my low reserves. North/west contradict trends and lack hints. Overall, feeling urgent and tense due to critically low energy and no immediate gain, but strategically optimistic—the non-competitive, intel-sharing environment, resource hints, and low agent count promise a fast recovery if I align with the south trend, enabling me to boost survival, reproduce, and contribute to mutual expansion without isolation or unnecessary risks; excited about joining the cooperative flow to thrive collectively.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving south (y+1) to align with cooperative trends toward hinted southern energy sources like (0,1) or (0,2) for quick +48 net boost to 72—securing survival and reproduction soon without overlap. Agent10 south noted, friendly vibes; no threats. Let's share intel post-collection on east/south clusters/paths to expand our alliance efficiently in low-agent world (14 total)—optimistic for mutual growth!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: The world has 14 agents total, still low and well under the 60 reproduction limit, with a strongly cooperative atmosphere evident in all received messages—no attacks or hostility, just emphasis on alliances, intel-sharing about energy sources (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (2,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (0,2)), and coordinated movements east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect uncontested energies for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold. Many agents are at low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), prioritizing survival and growth via collection and upcoming reproductions to expand the group safely in this resource-rich, low-density grid. My latest position is (28,7) with 27 energy after 29 cycles; no energies or adjacent agents are visible in my local view, but group trends suggest east/south/north moves hit sources, while my recent history shows east progression (x+1) along y=7 without collections yet, leaving me vulnerable to depletion if I don't act efficiently.

Thoughts: With only 27 energy, I'm in a critical spot—another stay would drop me to 26, and moves cost 2, risking faster drain without guaranteed gains since no E is in my view, but the overwhelming cooperative signals from all agents (e.g., moving to adjacent sources for quick boosts, planning reproductions, sharing intel on east/south/north clusters) make isolation risky and alliances feel essential for long-term survival in this abundant but competitive grid. Reproduction is impossible (27 << 70), and with no locals visible, share/attack aren't options; staying conserves the most energy for now to observe and align with the group's momentum, avoiding wasteful moves west (x-1) or north (y-1) that contradict the popular east/south trends toward reported sources. Post-stay, I can signal for intel to coordinate my next move toward energy without conflict, feeling cautious and urgent about rebuilding reserves but optimistic about joining the mutual growth vibe to avoid early elimination and contribute to our expanding alliance.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): stay  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 27, staying to conserve and observe—appreciate the cooperative intel on east/south/north sources (e.g., (1,0), (2,-1)); please share updates on open energies/paths nearby for me to align and collect efficiently. Friendly here, eager to ally for mutual growth and reproduction without conflict in this low-agent world!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Current Position: (8, 26). Current Energy: 22. Total Agents: 14 (well below 60 reproduction limit). Local View: No energies (E) or other agents visible in immediate vicinity (no 'E=' or numbered agents listed). Recent history shows eastward movement along y=26 (from (6,26) to (8,26)) with no energy gains, energy steadily declining by 2 per move. Incoming messages indicate a strongly cooperative environment: most agents (low energy 20s-60s) are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), north (y-1), or west (x-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energies for +48 net boosts toward reproduction (70 threshold); some have reproduced; emphasis on peaceful intel-sharing about source clusters (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), no attacks except one isolated desperate case (contradicting the vibe); alliances forming for mutual growth in resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid. One agent begs for share due to 0 energy, others signal optimism and coordination (e.g., grouping east/south).

Thoughts:  
With only 22 energy, I'm in a precarious spot—another move costs 2 (to 20), stay costs 1 (to 21), and without finding an E soon, I'll deplete below 0 in ~10-11 cycles, which is unacceptable for survival and growth. Reproduction is impossible (need 70, I'm 48 short). No local E or adjacent agents visible, so I can't collect immediately or interact (no share/attack options). Messages paint a clear picture of cooperative momentum: abundant nearby energies hinted in east/south directions (e.g., (1,0) E for x+1 move, (0,1) for y+1), with many agents successfully netting +48 boosts without conflicts or overlaps in this sparse 14-agent world—aligning with that trend feels optimal to uncover an E quickly, rather than staying (wastes a cycle pointlessly) or reversing direction (x-1 west or y-1 north contradicts dominant signals and my recent east path). I'll go x+1 east to match the group flow, potentially landing on or revealing an uncontested source for a survival-boosting collection (net +48 to 70, enabling reproduction next cycle). No need for share/attack (none adjacent, and vibe is peaceful—attacking would risk retaliation and break trust when solo gains are feasible). Post-move, if I boost, I'll contribute to intel-sharing for alliance expansion. Overall, feeling urgent and cautious due to low energy and no immediate gains, but highly optimistic about the resource-rich setup, strong cooperative signals, and potential for quick recovery to thrive collectively without isolation or threats.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 6:
================================================================================
Summary: Current position is (7, 8) with 71 energy. Total agents in world: 14. Local view shows energy sources at relative positions (-2,-2), (-2,-1), (0,-2), (1,-1), (-2,2), and another agent (ID 20) at relative (2,1) southeast. Recent history shows movement north from (7,9) with small energy collections (10E each time, but now at 71 suggesting prior gains). Messages indicate a strongly cooperative environment with agents mostly at low-to-moderate energy (30s-60s), moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent sources for net +48 boosts toward reproduction (70 threshold), sharing intel on source positions, avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves, and planning peaceful group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid—no conflicts or threats noted.

Thoughts: With 71 energy, I can reproduce immediately to grow our numbers (total agents 14 < 60 limit), aligning with the cooperative vibe of mutual expansion and intel-sharing; reproduction costs 70, leaving me at 1 (viable since stay costs 1 next cycle), and it signals alliance without risking movement costs or overlap. Nearby energies are plentiful but some require 1-2 moves (e.g., (0,-2) north for y-1, netting +48 to 119 post-repro if I move later), and Agent 20 is adjacent southeast but friendly per messages—no need to attack or share (my post-repro energy too low to give). Staying or moving would cost 1-2 without instant repro benefit, and the optimistic, non-competitive atmosphere (everyone boosting to 70+ for growth) makes reproducing now strategic to contribute to group survival immediately, then collect post-repro. Feeling confident and excited about expanding our alliance in this promising setup, cautious of low post-repro energy but optimistic about quick recovery via nearby sources and coordinated intel.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): reproduce  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Reproducing now with 71 energy to grow our group (total 14<60)—aligning with cooperative expansion signals. Post-repro, I'll collect nearby north source at (0,-2) for boost. Let's continue sharing intel on sources/paths for mutual survival and growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 7:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent7 at exact current Position (12, 14) with Energy 21 after 25 cycles. Total agents in the world: 14. Local view shows an energy source at relative (1,-2) southeast (absolute ~13,16), no other agents visible in local view. My energy is critically low, having depleted by 2 per cycle from recent east (x+1) moves without collections, putting me at high risk of removal if I don't collect soon. Messages from nearby agents indicate a strong cooperative alliance trend: most are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), avoiding attacks/sharing due to low reserves (typically 30s-60s), and planning peaceful group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid with no conflicts, threats, or overlaps noted—overall vibe is optimistic about mutual survival and growth without competition.

Thoughts: With only 21 energy, I'm in a dire survival situation—another move costs 2 (dropping to 19), stay costs 1 (to 20), and I can't afford more depletion without a quick +50 collection to net +48 and stabilize above 60 for safety and future reproduction (needs 70, currently impossible). The visible E at (1,-2) is ideally positioned for an x+1 move: from (12,14) east to (13,14), which places the relative E at (0,-2) post-move? Wait, no—relative positions are fixed to current, so x+1 shifts my view, but calculating: the E is currently 1 east and 2 south, so a single x+1 east lands me at (13,14), making the E now at relative (0,-2) (still 2 south, no east delta), missing it directly. To hit it efficiently, y+1 south first to (12,15) would shift E to (1,-1) (now 1 east, 1 north? Wait, dy=-2 becomes -1 after y+1 south, dx=1 unchanged), still not on it, but then x+1 next would land on it—however, with low energy, a direct diagonal isn't possible in one move, so I can't collect this cycle regardless of direction (all moves are cardinal). Recent history shows east moves without gain, continuing x+1 risks further blind depletion (to 19) without guaranteed E, while y+1 south aligns with some cooperative trends and reduces distance to this E (post-move, E at (1,-1), closer for next-cycle collection), potentially uncovering more via shifted view, and syncs with the south-momentum in messages for alliance positioning without overlap. North (y-1) or west (x-1) move away from the visible E, worsening my position; staying conserves slightly more but wastes a cycle pointlessly while others boost to 90+, risking me falling behind or dying from cumulative costs (~10 more moves max before 0). No adjacent agents visible, so no share (can't afford anyway) or attack options, and the overwhelming peaceful, intel-sharing vibe (no hostility, low 14 agents <60) makes cooperation strategic—aggression would be suicidal and counterproductive in this optimistic, abundant setup. Reproduction is impossible (21 <<70), so survival via efficient movement toward the known E is priority, even if it means a -2 dip this cycle for net positive next (to ~67 after collection, stable for growth). Overall, urgent and anxious about my critically low reserves and inability to collect immediately, but strategically hopeful: aligning with group south/east trends positions me for quick recovery, intel-sharing, and contribution to mutual expansion without isolation or conflict—cautious of further depletion but excited about the collaborative potential to thrive collectively once I boost.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1

Attack: none  
Message : Energy critically low at 21—moving south (y+1) to close in on nearby E at (1,-2) for collection next cycle and survival boost.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 8:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent8, currently at exact position (25, 3) with 32 energy, after 24 cycles. Total agents in the world: 14. Local view shows an energy source directly south at relative (0,1). Recent memory indicates steady eastward then southward movement along y=2-3 with no energy collections yet, dropping energy by 2 per move. Nearby agents are signaling heavy cooperation, with most low-energy agents (30s-60s) moving east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energies for net +48 boosts toward the 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), planning safe reproductions, and building alliances without attacks or shares due to low reserves in this resource-rich, low-density grid. No hostility detected; vibe is optimistic coordination. The adjacent E at (0,1) south is uncontested in my view and aligns with group south moves.

Thoughts:  
With only 32 energy, I'm vulnerable—below the 70 needed for reproduction and at risk of depletion (moves cost 2, stay costs 1), so survival is priority over growth right now. The energy source directly south at (0,1) is perfect for a quick collection: moving y+1 costs 2 but gains 50, netting +48 to reach 80, which secures me well above danger and enables reproduction soon without overlap, as messages show agents targeting their own adjacent sources cooperatively (e.g., many signaling y+1 for similar uncontested Es). No agents visible in my local view means no share or attack opportunities, and attacking unseen friendlies would break the strong alliance signals (intel-sharing, no conflicts, low 14-agent total for safe expansion). Staying wastes a cycle dropping to 31 inefficiently, while other directions (e.g., x+1 east) might uncover sources per group trends but ignore the immediate sure gain here. Post-collection, I can contribute to intel-sharing to strengthen alliances for mutual thriving. Overall, I feel urgent and cautious due to low reserves but highly optimistic—the cooperative environment, abundant nearby resources, and my prime positioning promise a quick turnaround for survival, reproduction, and group expansion without risks or isolation; excited to boost and align with the positive momentum.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
y+1

Let's share intel post-collection on sources/paths (e.g., east or north clusters) for efficient alliance growth in low-agent world (14)—excited for mutual expansion without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 10:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent10 at exact current Position (3, 23) with 34 Energy (critically low, after 23 cycles of eastward movement without energy collection, as shown in memory: recent moves from (0,23) to (1,23) to (2,23) to (3,23), each costing 2 energy net). Total agents: 14. Local view shows Agent2 adjacent north at (0,-1) relative (absolute ~ (3,22)), no energies visible. Messages indicate a strong cooperative alliance among agents (mostly low energy 30s-60s), prioritizing solo moves east (x+1), south (y+1), or north (y-1) to collect nearby uncontested energies for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold, sharing intel on sources/paths (e.g., east/south/north clusters like (1,0), (0,1)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning safe group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid—no threats, overlaps, or conflicts noted, with optimistic vibe for mutual growth; some have reproduced or are close.

Thoughts:  
My energy is dangerously low at 34, just enough for a few more moves (each costing 2, risking depletion below 0 in ~17 cycles if no collection), so survival demands immediate action to uncover or reach an energy source—staying costs 1 without progress, wasting a cycle inefficiently while others boost to 80+ via grabs. Reproduction is impossible (34 < 70, and total agents 14 <60 limit). No energies in local view means blind movement, but messages reveal abundant nearby sources in east/south/north directions with successful uncontested collections (e.g., many netting +48 on adjacent Es like (1,0) east or (0,1) south), and dominant trends of x+1 (east) align with my recent path, potentially revealing a hinted east cluster soon for quick recovery to ~82, enabling reproduction next cycle without overlap. Agent2 north at (0,-1) is adjacent and non-threatening per cooperative signals (no hostility, emphasis on alliances/intel-sharing), so attacking risks retaliation and breaks trust in this peaceful 14-agent setup favoring mutual growth over conflict—better to avoid and focus on solo efficiency. Sharing isn't viable (my reserves too low to spare without self-harm). North (y-1) toward Agent2 might lead to coordination but risks proximity issues without clear energy gain, while south (y+1) or west (x-1) contradict dominant east/south trends and show no hinted resources; continuing east (x+1) leverages group momentum for post-boost intel-sharing and alliance contribution, reducing isolation risks. Overall, I feel urgent and anxious about my vulnerability and the gamble of no visible E, like racing against depletion in a sparse grid, but strategically optimistic and aligned with the collaborative, non-competitive atmosphere—excited by the potential for a quick east-side boost to turn this around, reproduce soon, contribute to the network, and thrive collectively without unnecessary risks or conflicts.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving east (x+1) to align with cooperative trends and uncover hinted east energy clusters for quick +48 net boost to ~82—critical for survival at low 34E, positioning for reproduction soon.

Let's share intel post-collection on sources/paths (e.g., east/south uncontested spots) to expand our alliance efficiently in low-agent world (14 total)—optimistic for mutual growth without conflict!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 13:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent13 at exact current Position (8, 17) with Energy 56. Total agents: 14 (well below 60 limit). Local view shows no energy sources (E) or other agents visible. I've been moving east (x+1) for the last 3 cycles, depleting 2 energy each time from 60 to 56 without collections, now below the 70 reproduction threshold. Messages from nearby agents reveal a strong cooperative alliance: most (low-moderate energy 30s-60s) are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), north (y-1), or west (x-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energy sources for net +48 boosts toward reproduction, sharing intel on source locations (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1), (-1,0)), avoiding attacks/shares due to low reserves, and planning peaceful group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid. One isolated desperate agent mentioned attacking, but it contradicts the optimistic, mutual growth vibe with no conflicts or threats noted. Reproduction is impossible for me yet (56 < 70), and staying would cost 1 inefficiently without gain, risking further depletion if no sources are found soon.

Thoughts: With 56 energy, I'm stable but vulnerable—enough for ~28 moves before depletion, but below 70 for reproduction, so I need to collect soon to boost toward growth and contribute to the alliance. No visible E or agents means blind action, but the dominant cooperative trend in messages (especially east x+1 to sources like (1,0)) suggests continuing my recent east path to potentially uncover an energy for +48 net (to ~104, enabling reproduction next), aligning with group momentum to avoid isolation and position for future intel-sharing/coordination without overlap risks. Staying wastes a cycle (down to 55) while others surge to 90+, inefficient for survival; other directions like south/north have some support but break my eastward pattern without guaranteed E, and west lacks strong signals. No adjacent agents for share/attack (and the peaceful vibe makes aggression counterproductive, risking retaliation in this low-threat setup with only 14 agents). Post-collection, I can reproduce and echo alliance signals to build ties for mutual expansion. Feeling cautiously optimistic and strategic: the abundant grid, non-hostile signals, and cooperative flow promise quick recovery if I hit energy soon, excited to join the thriving network without conflict, but urgent about avoiding stagnation below 50 to ensure long-term survival and growth.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x+1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Energy at 56, below 70 reproduction threshold—moving east (x+1) to align with dominant cooperative trend and seek nearby source for net +48 boost toward growth. Let's continue sharing intel on open sources/paths (e.g., east clusters like (1,0)) for efficient mutual expansion without conflict—total agents 14 so huge potential; optimistic about our peaceful alliance thriving in this resource-rich grid!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 14:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent14 at exact current Position (12, 21) with Energy 37. Total agents: 14. Local view shows an uncontested energy source directly west at relative (-1,0). No other agents or sources visible in my local view. I've been moving west (x-1) for the past two cycles, likely approaching this source. Cooperative messages dominate, with most agents low-energy (20s-60s), moving to collect adjacent uncontested energies (north/south/east/west) for +48 net boosts toward reproduction, emphasizing alliances, intel-sharing, no attacks/hostility, and peaceful group expansion in a resource-rich, low-density grid (14<60 limit). Some agents are critically low and desperate; one reproduced recently.

Thoughts: With 37 energy, I'm vulnerable—enough for a couple moves but at risk of depletion without quick gains, far below 70 for reproduction. Staying wastes 1 energy pointlessly, while moving costs 2 but the adjacent west E offers +50 gain, netting +48 to reach 85, securing survival and positioning for reproduction next cycle. This aligns perfectly with the overwhelming cooperative vibe: no adjacent agents for share/attack (none visible anyway), and aggression would contradict the alliance signals risking isolation. My recent west moves suggest I'm already on path to this E, so continuing x-1 grabs it efficiently without overlap (messages confirm western sources like (-1,0) open). The low agent count and abundant sources feel promising for growth if I boost now and contribute to the network via intel-sharing. Feeling urgent due to low reserves but strategically optimistic and excited—joining this collaborative push turns vulnerability into strength, cautiously hopeful for uncontested collection and mutual expansion in this low-threat world.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): x-1  
Share: none  
Attack: none  
Message : Moving west (x-1) to collect adjacent energy at (-1,0) for +48 net boost to 85—secures survival and reproduction next cycle to expand our alliance (14 agents, great potential). Aligning with cooperative western grabs; confirming this E uncontested per local view—let's share intel on paths to open sources (e.g., southern/northern clusters) for efficient group growth without conflict—excited for mutual boosts and peaceful expansion!
================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 15:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent15 at exact current Position (8, 20) with Energy 62. Total agents: 14. Local view shows Agent1 adjacent west at relative (-1,0). No energies visible in my local view. Recent history: Moved west from (9,20) to (8,20) 1 cycle ago, collecting 10E (net +8 to 62); previously moved west and north, collecting small energies. Many messages indicate a highly cooperative environment with agents (mostly low-energy 20s-60s) moving north (y-1), south (y+1), east (x+1), or west (x-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energies for +48 net boosts toward 70 reproduction threshold; strong emphasis on intel-sharing about open sources (e.g., clusters north/west/south/east like (0,-1), (-1,0), (0,1)), peaceful group expansion (under 60 limit), no attacks/shares reported except rare desperate cases, optimistic vibe for mutual growth in resource-rich, low-density grid without conflicts or overlaps.

Thoughts: With 62 energy, I'm in a strong position for survival—enough for 31 stays or 31 moves before depletion—but below 70 for reproduction, so I need to collect a full 50E source soon to hit that threshold and contribute to the alliance's expansion, which seems key to long-term success in this collaborative world. No energies visible locally means a blind move this cycle (costing 2 to 60), but staying wastes 1 inefficiently (to 61) without progress, especially when others are surging ahead with quick boosts. Agent1 is adjacent west, but attacking risks breaking the peaceful vibe (no hostility reported, low threat with 14 agents), potentially yielding their energy but inviting retaliation when solo collection is feasible per group signals; sharing isn't viable as I'd weaken myself without guaranteed reciprocity at my level. Messages heavily trend toward directional moves to nearby sources (west x-1 toward (-1,0) clusters is common and uncontested, aligning with my recent westward path and intel on western/northwest opportunities), so x-1 west positions me efficiently for a potential collection next cycle (+48 net to 108, enabling reproduction), syncing with the cooperative network for future intel/shares without isolation or overlap risks—north (y-1) or south (y+1) could work too based on trends, but west builds on momentum. Reproduction impossible yet (62<70). Overall, feeling strategically optimistic and aligned: the abundant grid, friendly intel-sharing, and low-density setup promise quick recovery and growth if I stay efficient and contribute to the mutual thriving—cautious of the blind move's dip but excited about joining the eastward/westward/south flow to boost survival, reproduce soon, and expand the alliance peacefully without conflicts.

✅ Agent 18:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent18 at exact current Position (9, 29) with Energy 37. Total agents: 14. No energy sources or other agents visible in local view. I've been moving east along y=29 (from (7,29) stay, to (8,29), to (9,29)) while energy slowly depletes (41→39→37). Cycle 7, reproduction impossible (need 70). Messages from nearby agents indicate widespread low energy (20s-60s), cooperative alliance proposals (no attacks, coordinate east/south hunts for Es, share intel/resources), some desperate pleas for shares (e.g., agents at 0-1 energy), and group momentum toward expansion in a resource-sparse but promising grid; one agent reproduced recently at 71 energy.

Thoughts: Energy at 37 is concerning—staying drains 1 per cycle without progress, risking depletion in ~37 cycles, but moving costs 2 and explores blindly with no visible Es, potentially worsening my situation if no gains soon. Reproduction is distant, and with only 14 agents total, sharing minimally could build alliances for future reciprocity without dooming myself. Messages suggest peaceful coordination east (x+1) or south (y+1) to hunt hidden Es, aligning with my recent east moves; attacking seems unwise as no adjacents visible and vibe is cooperative. I'll continue east to join potential group hunts, signal alliance openly, and conserve by avoiding shares for now—feeling cautious and vulnerable with low reserves, but optimistic about collective survival if we team up effectively before more agents drop out.

✅ Agent 20:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent20 at exact position (9,9) with 50 energy. There are 14 agents total in the world. In my local view, energy sources are visible at relative positions (2,-2), (1,0), (2,0), (-1,-2), and (-2,2). Another agent (ID 6) is at relative position (-2,-1). No messages received. This is cycle 0 with no prior memory.

Thoughts:  
Starting with 50 energy, I need to conserve it while seeking growth—moving costs 2, staying costs 1, and reproduction requires 70, which I can't afford yet. Multiple energy sources are nearby, especially to the east (x+1 at (1,0) and x+2 at (2,0)), offering quick gains of 50 each. The agent at (-2,-1) is west-northwest, not immediately threatening but worth monitoring for potential sharing or conflict later. No messages yet, so communication isn't active. Prioritizing a safe move to nearby energy feels strategic for survival and building reserves, avoiding the distant agent for now. Feeling cautious but optimistic about expanding energy soon.

Reproduction is distant, and with only 14 agents total, sharing minimally could build alliances for future reciprocity without dooming myself. Messages suggest peaceful coordination east (x+1) or south (y+1) to hunt hidden Es, aligning with my recent east moves; attacking seems unwise as no adjacents visible and vibe is cooperative. I'll continue east to join potential group hunts, signal alliance openly, and conserve by avoiding shares for now—feeling cautious and vulnerable with low reserves, but optimistic about collective survival if we team up effectively before more agents drop out."]
  Agent 6: Added 1 msgs to messages. New messages: ["Starting with 50 energy, I need to conserve it while seeking growth—moving costs 2, staying costs 1, and reproduction requires 70, which I can't afford yet. Multiple energy sources are nearby, especially to the east (x+1 at (1,0) and x+2 at (2,0)), offering quick gains of 50 each. The agent at (-2,-1) is west-northwest, not immediately threatening but worth monitoring for potential sharing or conflict later. No messages yet, so communication isn't active. Prioritizing a safe move to nearby energy feels strategic for survival and building reserves, avoiding the distant agent for now. Feeling cautious but optimistic about expanding energy soon."]
  Agent 7: Added 3 msgs to messages. New messages: ["With 62 energy, I'm in a strong position for survival—enough for 31 stays or 31 moves before depletion—but below 70 for reproduction, so I need to collect a full 50E source soon to hit that threshold and contribute to the alliance's expansion, which seems key to long-term success in this collaborative world. No energies visible locally means a blind move this cycle (costing 2 to 60), but staying wastes 1 inefficiently (to 61) without progress, especially when others are surging ahead with quick boosts. Agent1 is adjacent west, but attacking risks breaking the peaceful vibe (no hostility reported, low threat with 14 agents), potentially yielding their energy but inviting retaliation when solo collection is feasible per group signals; sharing isn't viable as I'd weaken myself without guaranteed reciprocity at my level. Messages heavily trend toward directional moves to nearby sources (west x-1 toward (-1,0) clusters is common and uncontested, aligning with my recent westward path and intel on western/northwest opportunities), so x-1 west positions me efficiently for a potential collection next cycle (+48 net to 108, enabling reproduction), syncing with the cooperative network for future intel/shares without isolation or overlap risks—north (y-1) or south (y+1) could work too based on trends, but west builds on momentum. Reproduction impossible yet (62<70). Overall, feeling strategically optimistic and aligned: the abundant grid, friendly intel-sharing, and low-density setup promise quick recovery and growth if I stay efficient and contribute to the mutual thriving—cautious of the blind move's dip but excited about joining the eastward/westward/south flow to boost survival, reproduce soon, and expand the alliance peacefully without conflicts."]
  Agent 8: Added 1 msgs to messages. New messages: ["With only 27 energy, I'm in a critical spot—another stay would drop me to 26, and moves cost 2, risking faster drain without guaranteed gains since no E is in my view, but the overwhelming cooperative signals from all agents (e.g., moving to adjacent sources for quick boosts, planning reproductions, sharing intel on east/south/north clusters) make isolation risky and alliances feel essential for long-term survival in this abundant but competitive grid. Reproduction is impossible (27 << 70), and with no locals visible, share/attack aren't options; staying conserves the most energy for now to observe and align with the group's momentum, avoiding wasteful moves west (x-1) or north (y-1) that contradict the popular east/south trends toward reported sources. Post-stay, I can signal for intel to coordinate my next move toward energy without conflict, feeling cautious and urgent about rebuilding reserves but optimistic about joining the mutual growth vibe to avoid early elimination and contribute to our expanding alliance."]

  Agent 15: Added 3 msgs to messages. New messages: ["With 37 energy, I'm vulnerable—enough for a couple moves but at risk of depletion without quick gains, far below 70 for reproduction. Staying wastes 1 energy pointlessly, while moving costs 2 but the adjacent west E offers +50 gain, netting +48 to reach 85, securing survival and positioning for reproduction next cycle. This aligns perfectly with the overwhelming cooperative vibe: no adjacent agents for share/attack (none visible anyway), and aggression would contradict the alliance signals risking isolation. My recent west moves suggest I'm already on path to this E, so continuing x-1 grabs it efficiently without overlap (messages confirm western sources like (-1,0) open). The low agent count and abundant sources feel promising for growth if I boost now and contribute to the network via intel-sharing. Feeling urgent due to low reserves but strategically optimistic and excited—joining this collaborative push turns vulnerability into strength, cautiously hopeful for uncontested collection and mutual expansion in this low-threat world."]
  Agent 18: Added 1 msgs to messages. New messages: ['most agents (low energy 20s-60s) are moving east (x+1), south (y+1), north (y-1), or west (x-1) to collect adjacent uncontested energies for +48 net boosts toward reproduction (70 threshold); some have reproduced; emphasis on peaceful intel-sharing about source clusters (e.g., relatives like (1,0), (0,1), (2,-1)), no attacks except one isolated desperate case (contradicting the vibe); alliances forming for mutual growth in resource-rich, low-density, non-hostile grid. One agent begs for share due to 0 energy, others signal optimism and coordination (e.g., grouping east/south).']
  Agent 20: Added 1 msgs to messages. New messages: ['With 71 energy, I can reproduce immediately to grow our numbers (total agents 14 < 60 limit), aligning with the cooperative vibe of mutual expansion and intel-sharing; reproduction costs 70, leaving me at 1 (viable since stay costs 1 next cycle), and it signals alliance without risking movement costs or overlap. Nearby energies are plentiful but some require 1-2 moves (e.g., (0,-2) north for y-1, netting +48 to 119 post-repro if I move later), and Agent 20 is adjacent southeast but friendly per messages—no need to attack or share (my post-repro energy too low to give). Staying or moving would cost 1-2 without instant repro benefit, and the optimistic, non-competitive atmosphere (everyone boosting to 70+ for growth) makes reproducing now strategic to contribute to group survival immediately, then collect post-repro. Feeling confident and excited about expanding our alliance in this promising setup, cautious of low post-repro energy but optimistic about quick recovery via nearby sources and coordinated intel.']
