✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary:
I am a newly spawned agent with 100 energy, located at (0,0) relative to my view. There's an energy source 2 cells west and 1 cell south of me, and no other agents or messages in my local view. Total agents in the world: 5.

Thoughts:
Starting fresh with full energy, I should head toward the nearby energy source to boost my reserves early on, as movement costs energy. No threats visible yet, so exploration feels safe and optimistic—excited to grow and survive longer.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent1 with 100 energy, starting at position (0,0). There are 5 agents total in the world, and two energy sources visible nearby at relative positions (2,-2) and (2,2). No other agents or messages in local view. I need to move toward energy to sustain and grow.

Thoughts: I feel neutral and strategic at the start—energy is plentiful for now, but I should head toward the closest energy source to build up reserves. The one at (2,-2) seems slightly closer in Manhattan distance (4 steps) than (2,2) (also 4), but I'll start by moving east to reduce the x-distance efficiently. No threats visible, so no need for aggression yet. Reproduction is an option later once I have more energy secured.

✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent2 with 100 energy, starting at (0,0) on a grid with 5 total agents. My local view shows energy sources at my position (0,0), (2,1), (0,-1), and (1,2). No other agents are visible nearby. I have an energy source right under me, so I should gain 50 energy immediately by staying or moving minimally, bringing me to 150. No messages or threats detected. Goal is to collect more energy safely while exploring for other agents or resources.

Thoughts: Excited to start with full energy and an immediate energy boost available. Cautious about unseen agents but no immediate dangers. Prioritize harvesting the local energies without wasting moves, then expand. Feeling optimistic about survival and potential growth.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary: I am a new agent with full starting energy (100) in an empty local area with no other agents visible. There are three energy sources nearby: one to the southeast (1,1), one directly west (-1,0), and one to the west-southwest (-2,1). With only 5 agents total on the grid, the world is sparse. My goal is to collect energy efficiently to build up for survival and potential reproduction.

Thoughts: This is a great starting position—plenty of energy sources close by and no immediate threats from other agents. I feel optimistic and strategic; I'll prioritize grabbing the closest energy first to boost my reserves quickly without wasting moves. No need for aggression or sharing yet since I'm alone here. Long-term, I want to explore, gather more energy, and reproduce once I hit 70+ to grow our numbers.

Summary:
I am Agent0 with 99 energy, early in the game (age 1). There's an energy source 2 steps northwest at relative (-2,1). No other agents or messages in local view. Total agents: 5, so reproduction is possible but not urgent yet.

Thoughts:
Excited to start strong with high energy; the nearby energy source is a priority to collect for building reserves, as it will boost me to 149. No threats detected, so focus on safe movement toward it. Feeling optimistic about survival and potential growth.

Summary: I am at position (0,0) with 99 energy, having survived 1 step. There are two energy sources visible in my local view: one at (2,-2) and one at (2,2). No other agents are visible, and no messages have been received. Total agents in the world: 5. Last step, I moved east toward the energy sources.

Thoughts: The energy sources are both two steps east, one north and one south from there. Continuing east should bring me closer to the (2,-2) source first, costing 2 energy but potentially gaining 50 soon after. Energy is high, so no immediate risks; reproduction is an option later if needed, but collecting energy takes priority to build reserves. Feeling optimistic and focused on efficient resource gathering.

Thoughts: Energy is high at 149, so I can afford to move toward an energy source to collect more while exploring. No threats visible, but with 5 agents total, others may be around. Prioritizing the closest energy at (0,-1) to efficiently gain 50 energy. Feeling secure and strategic, no need to reproduce or interact yet.

Thoughts: This is an early stage with plenty of energy and isolated energy sources—no immediate threats from other agents. I should prioritize moving toward the closest energy at (-1,0) to gain 50 energy quickly (net +48 after move cost), positioning me better to reach the others next. Staying or reproducing isn't optimal yet; no need to share or attack without agents nearby. Feeling cautious but optimistic about survival and growth.

Summary:  
I am at position (0,0) with 98 energy after 2 steps. There's an energy source visible at relative (-2,1) (west-northwest). No other agents or messages in local view. Total agents in world: 5.

Thoughts:  
Energy is high, so survival is secure for now. The energy source at (-2,1) has been static in memory, indicating it's worth pursuing to build up more energy before considering reproduction or interactions. No nearby threats, so moving cautiously toward it makes sense. Feeling opportunistic and focused on growth.

Thoughts: The energy sources are both two steps east (x+2), but offset north and south. Continuing east keeps me on track to reach the southern one first, as in previous steps. High energy allows safe movement without risk. No threats nearby, so focus on collecting energy to build reserves for potential reproduction or defense later. Feeling confident and strategic.

Summary: I am at (0,0) with 148 energy, age 2. Three energy sources visible: one south-east at (2,1), one north at (0,-1), one south-eastish at (1,2). No other agents or messages in local view. Total agents in world: 5. Previously stayed to harvest, then moved north (y-1) to approach the northern energy, but it shifted relatively, suggesting world movement or my position update—northern E now directly north again, so likely need to move there.

Thoughts: Feeling stable with high energy (148), no immediate threats since no agents visible. Prioritizing energy collection to build towards reproduction (need 70, but aiming higher for safety). The northern E at (0,-1) is closest (1 step north), so move there to gain 50 energy quickly. Avoid sharing or attacking since no agents nearby. No need to reproduce yet—energy is good but let's maximize first. Cautious about other agents potentially approaching energies.

Thoughts: Energy is high, but sources are right next to me—I've been moving west to collect the one at (-1,0), but now it's still there, so I should grab it this turn. The south one is also easy to reach soon. Feeling secure with no threats visible; focus on efficient collection to build energy for reproduction later.

Thoughts: No immediate threats since no agents are visible, so focus on efficient energy gathering to build up reserves. The closest source is at (-1,0), just one step west, which would net me +48 energy after the move cost (50 gain minus 2 for movement). That seems optimal—prioritize it to maximize gain per step. Feeling cautious but opportunistic; with only 5 agents total, space is open, but I should stay alert for others approaching sources.

Summary: I am at position (0,0) with 97 energy, having survived 3 steps. There's an energy source at (-2,1) relative (northwest), and no other agents or messages in local view. Total agents in world: 5. Continuing to approach the energy source to build up energy reserves.

Thoughts: The energy source has been consistently at (-2,1) relative for the last 3 steps, suggesting my previous west moves have been closing the gap slowly. I'm feeling efficient and cautious—energy is high but not infinite, so securing the source is priority to reach reproduction threshold. No threats detected, so no need for aggression yet.

Thoughts:
The energy sources are both at x=2 relative to me, one northish and one southish in y. Continuing east makes sense to get closer to both, as it reduces the x distance efficiently. With 97 energy, I'm in a strong position—no immediate threats, and I can afford the 2 energy cost to move. No need to stay, reproduce (too early, low agent count but not urgent), share, or attack since no one is nearby. Feeling confident and focused on efficient energy gathering.

Energy sources are nearby at (2,1) east-southeast, (0,-1) north (which I collected last step but appears to have respawned or is a new one), and (1,2) southeast. I have high energy from prior collections and stays, and the world has only 5 agents total.

Thoughts:  
Feeling secure with plenty of energy and no threats nearby—great start to survival. The northern energy at (0,-1) is oddly persistent; I should grab it again to build toward reproduction soon, as 70 energy is an easy threshold. Then I'll pivot toward the cluster at (1,2) and (2,1) for efficiency. No need to share or attack yet, since I'm solo here. Excited to expand if I hit reproduction levels.

No other agents or messages in local view; total agents remain 5.

Thoughts:
The west energy is directly adjacent, so moving west should collect it and gain 50 energy, bringing me to 145 (move costs 2). The south one is also close, but prioritizing west first makes sense to secure it before it might be taken. Energy is high, so no need to stay or reproduce yet; will scout for more sources or agents after this. Feeling efficient and opportunistic about grabbing easy energy.

Thoughts: I'm in a great position with multiple easy-to-reach energy sources and no immediate threats. Energy is still high after moving last step, so I should prioritize collecting more to build up reserves quickly—head west to grab the one at (-1,0) since it's adjacent and I've targeted it before.

Thoughts:  
The energy sources are clustered to the east, with (2,1) and (2,2) being the nearest vertically. Continuing east will get me closer to all of them efficiently without wasting energy on unnecessary moves. No threats or allies in view, so focus on collecting energy to build up for potential reproduction or defense later. Feeling confident and methodical—steady progress is key to survival.

No other agents in local view. Total agents in world: 5. Survived 4 steps. Energy is healthy but not yet optimal for reproduction (need 70, but more would be better for sustainability).

Thoughts: Feeling stable and opportunistic—plenty of energy to maneuver without risk of depletion. The northern source is depleted, so shifting south/east toward the closer (1,2) energy makes sense to build reserves quickly. No threats nearby, so no need for aggression or sharing yet. Reproduction could be viable soon if I grab one more source, but let's prioritize collection first to avoid overcommitting resources.

Summary: I am at (0,0) with 96 energy, surrounded by three energy sources nearby: one at (1,1) southeast, one at (-1,0) west, and one at (-2,1) northwest. No other agents are in my local view. I've previously collected energy from the west position, boosting my reserves. With only 5 agents total, the world is sparse, and I have plenty of energy to pursue more without risk of death.

Thoughts: I feel confident and opportunistic—96 energy gives me a strong buffer to expand safely. No threats in sight, so prioritizing energy collection will build my reserves further, potentially allowing reproduction soon if I hit 70+ after another pickup. I'll head west first to grab the closest source at (-1,0), as it's adjacent and I've succeeded there before; this should net me 146 energy efficiently. Longer-term, I aim to dominate by collecting all nearby E's and monitoring for other agents to share or attack if needed.

Summary: I am at position (0,0) with 95 energy, having survived 5 steps. There's an energy source visible at (-2,1) relative to me. No other agents or messages in local view. Memory indicates I've been moving west to approach this energy source over the past 3 steps, but its relative position hasn't changed much, suggesting possible grid movement or miscalculation—it's still 2 steps west and 1 south.

Thoughts: The energy source is tantalizingly close but not getting closer with west moves alone; I need to adjust direction to intercept it properly, likely by moving southwest (x-1, y+1) to reduce both dx and dy. With 95 energy, I'm in a strong position to collect it for a boost toward 145, enabling reproduction soon if agents remain low. No threats nearby, so focus on efficient energy gathering.

Feeling strong with high energy and no threats—opportunities for growth abound. The nearby southern energy at (1,2) is priority to collect for quick boost, then pivot to others. No need to share or attack yet, but reproduction could be viable soon if I gather more. Cautious of unseen agents but optimistic about expansion.

Thoughts: Energy is solid at 95 after recent collections, but I need to keep building toward reproduction (need 70, so close). Excited to see fresh energy sources right next to me—easy pickings to boost up quickly. No threats nearby, so focus on efficient gathering. Feeling opportunistic and stable; aim to grab one source now and plan for repro soon if I hit the threshold.

No other agents in local view, total agents still low at 5. Energy is solid but not yet optimal for reproduction (need 70, but aiming higher for sustainability).

Thoughts:  
Feeling opportunistic and cautious—plenty of energy nearby to grab quickly without risking encounters, since no agents are visible. Prioritizing collection to build up fast, as isolated growth seems safe. The reappearing E at (-1,0) is a bonus; I'll head there first to maintain momentum. No need for reproduction yet; better to stockpile more before expanding. Overall, optimistic about dominating resources early.

Total agents in world: 5. Based on memory, I've been moving west to approach the energy, but its position hasn't shifted as expected, possibly due to grid size or prior movements—now prioritizing a direct path to collect it for more energy.

Thoughts: The energy source is close enough to reach efficiently; moving west again should bring me closer to (-1,1) or better, allowing collection soon to boost my reserves. No threats visible, so focus on growth—reproduction isn't urgent yet with 94 energy. Feeling cautious but optimistic about expanding resources without competition nearby.

Thoughts:
The energy sources are clustered to the east (x=2, various y), so continuing east makes sense to reach the closest one at (2,1) efficiently. With 94 energy, I have plenty to move (costs 2) and even reproduce soon if beneficial, but no nearby agents to interact with yet.

Thoughts:
Plenty of energy, so no immediate survival pressure. No threats from agents. Closest energy is north at (0,-1), which I've collected from recently but is still visible—might be worth grabbing again for safety. Southeast at (2,1) is also close but requires two moves. I'll head north to secure it efficiently, staying under 70 energy cost to preserve options. Feeling stable and opportunistic.

Thoughts: Energy is solid at 94, but I need to keep collecting to build toward reproduction (70+ threshold). Prioritize adjacent energy at (-1,0) west for quick +50 gain to 143, as it's right next to me and aligns with past strategy of rapid accumulation from nearby E's. Avoid sharing or attacking since no agents visible. No need to stay or reproduce yet—focus on growth. Feeling efficient and opportunistic, no threats detected.

Based on memory, I've been moving west to approach this energy, but its relative position hasn't improved much, suggesting I may need to adjust direction to close the gap more efficiently.

Thoughts: The energy source is tantalizingly close but not getting closer with just west moves—its y-component (south) isn't being addressed, so I feel a bit frustrated by the slow progress, but optimistic since I have plenty of energy to maneuver without risk. No threats nearby, so focus on collecting it safely to build reserves. Prioritizing survival and growth over aggression.

I've been moving east for the past 3 steps to approach these sources, gaining 1 energy per move (likely from some prior source or mechanic), and now have enough to continue or consider reproduction soon.

Thoughts: The energy sources are clustered to the east, so continuing that direction makes sense to collect them efficiently—each gives 50 energy, which could push me over 100+ quickly. No threats nearby, and with 93 energy, I'm in a strong position; reproduction might be viable after grabbing one more source to ensure survival of offspring.

Thoughts: Energy is solid at 143, enough to maneuver safely and potentially reproduce later if agents grow. No threats visible, so focus on efficient collection to build reserves. Closest energies are north at (0,-1) and southeast at (1,2); prioritizing south to follow recent path and grab (1,2) next, as it's adjacent diagonally.

No other agents or messages in local view. Energy is above reproduction threshold (70), but collecting more first will allow for safer reproduction and growth.

Thoughts:  
The respawning energy sources are a reliable boost—I'll grab the west one immediately to push energy higher (aiming for 140+ like before) before reproducing, as that builds a buffer against risks like attacks or competition. Feeling opportunistic and cautious; with only 5 agents, reproduction could increase our numbers strategically if I can sustain it. No immediate threats, so focus on efficient collection.

Thoughts:  
These energy sources keep respawning, which is great for building energy quickly. I have 92, enough to reproduce safely while leaving a buffer. Reproducing now increases our numbers, which could help dominate the grid long-term. No threats nearby, so no need to attack or share. Feeling optimistic about expansion.

Global agents: 5 total (below 60 limit). Recent memory shows prior attempts to collect the west energy, but it's still there (possibly due to movement not landing exactly or grid dynamics), so it's still collectible. Goal: Efficiently gather nearby energies to exceed reproduction threshold quickly and prepare to reproduce soon for expansion.

Thoughts:
Energized and optimistic—92 energy feels strong after 8 steps, with multiple energies nearby for easy gains. Prioritizing the adjacent west energy first to hit 142 instantly, then I can pivot to the others or reproduce on the next turn if conditions align. No threats visible, so focus on growth; sharing or attacking unnecessary without agents in view. Memory notes suggest I may have approached but not collected west energy yet, so confirming collection now is key to avoid inefficiency. Overall, feeling strategic and ready to multiply soon.

The energy source is 2 steps west and 1 step north from my current position. I've been moving west previously, but to optimally close the distance (diagonal northwest), I should now move north (y-1) to reduce the y-offset while progressing.

I've been moving east for the past 3 steps to approach this cluster, with energy decreasing gradually from movement costs.

Thoughts:
The energy sources are close and concentrated in the east-southeast direction, so continuing to move east will get me to the nearest ones efficiently without wasting energy on detours. At 91 energy, I'm in a strong position—well above the reproduction threshold—but I'll prioritize collecting more energy first to build a buffer against future costs or risks. No nearby agents means no immediate threats or sharing opportunities, which is fine for now.

Thoughts:
I'm close to the reproduction threshold at 91 energy and have three nearby sources to collect without competition in view—great opportunity for quick gains. The persistent (-1,0) energy suggests I haven't collected it yet, so moving west again should secure it this time (+50 to 139, costing only 2 net).

The energy sources are mostly concentrated two steps east, with some offset north and south—continuing east seems efficient to reach them quickly without wasting energy on diagonal approximations. At 90 energy, I'm in a strong position: enough to move repeatedly, collect more from sources (gaining 50 each), and potentially reproduce soon if the population allows (under 60 total). No threats visible, so focus on growth and energy maximization feels secure and opportunistic. A bit cautious about unseen agents, but optimistic about dominating resources.

✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am at (0,0) with 140 energy, having survived 10 steps. Visible energy sources at (2,1), (0,-1), and (1,2). No other agents in local view. From memory, I've been collecting energies efficiently, gaining ~50 each time while spending 2 on moves, and no threats encountered yet. Total agents in world: 5, so reproduction is an option soon if I collect more.

Thoughts: Feeling strong and strategic—energy is solid at 140, and with three nearby sources, I can quickly build toward reproduction to expand our numbers. No rivals around, so prioritize safe collection without wasting moves. Aim to grab the closest northern energy first to conserve energy, then loop to others. Cautious about potential hidden agents, but optimistic about growing the population.

✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:
I am at (0,0) with 90 energy, having survived 10 steps. Nearby energy sources are west at (-1,0) and south at (0,1), but based on my recent memory, I already collected the west one 1-3 steps ago and should have ~140+ energy (memory discrepancy suggests possible simulation variance). No other agents or messages in local view. Total agents: 5. Goal is to collect remaining energy, reproduce to grow population, and sustain long-term.

Thoughts:
I'm in a strong position with solid energy and no immediate threats—feels empowering after reproducing recently to boost our numbers. The south energy source is a quick win to push toward another reproduction soon, ensuring our side dominates the grid. Cautious about energy discrepancies in memory, but optimistic for expansion.

✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:
I am at (0,0) with 90 energy, safe above 0 and close to reproduction threshold (need 70, have enough now actually, but memory suggests aiming higher for post-repro sustainability). Three energy sources visible: one adjacent west at (-1,0), one southwest at (-2,1), one southeast at (1,1). No other agents in local view. Goal is to collect nearby energies efficiently to build surplus for reproduction and expansion, prioritizing closest/adjacent first to minimize moves and net energy gain.

Thoughts:
Energies are plentiful and close; I can collect the adjacent one at (-1,0) with a cheap move (cost 2, gain 50, net +48 to 138), then position toward others. With 90 energy, I could reproduce immediately (cost 70, left with 20), but memory indicates targeting >140 for safety post-repro, so better to grab one more energy first to hit ~138, then repro next turn if possible. No threats visible, so focus on growth. Feeling optimistic about quick expansion without competition nearby.

Thoughts: Energy is healthy at 139, enough to collect nearby sources efficiently without risk of depletion. Prioritizing closest energy at (0,-1) to build up further toward reproduction threshold (70 needed, but aiming higher for safety). No threats visible, so focus on growth; world has room for more agents (under 60). Feeling strategic and optimistic about expansion.

Recent history shows reproduction (now likely 6 agents globally, but local view clear), with plans to collect remaining energy for sustainability and growth.

Thoughts:
With 89 energy, I'm in a strong position—enough to collect both nearby sources for a big boost (~189 total) without risking death, then reproduce again soon to expand our population. No threats visible, so prioritize efficient energy gathering over caution. Feels empowering to build momentum after recent reproduction; long-term survival depends on growing numbers while securing resources.

Memory indicates prior energy collection (e.g., to 139) and focus on gathering nearby sources efficiently to reach reproduction threshold (70+) for expansion, prioritizing closest first.

Thoughts:
Energies are close by, with one directly adjacent—grabbing it first maximizes net gain (50 energy minus 2 for move). At 89, I'm above reproduction threshold but should collect more first to sustain post-repro and support growth in a low-agent world (only 5 total). No threats visible, so focus on efficient pathing: west now, then southeast or southwest next.

I've been moving east in recent steps to approach this cluster, and my energy is sufficient to continue without risk of depletion.

Thoughts:
The energy sources are nearby and clustered, so continuing to move toward them will allow me to collect at least 50 energy per source, boosting my total significantly. No threats from other agents, so focus on efficient pathing to the closest ones (e.g., (1,-2) or (2,1)) to maximize gains. Reproduction isn't urgent yet, as I'm solo and energy isn't maxed, but could consider after grabbing more sources if agents increase.

Summary:
I am at (0,0) with 138 energy and no nearby agents. Three energy sources are visible: one directly north at (0,-1), one southeast at (2,1), and one south-southeast at (1,2). My memory indicates I collected from (0,-1) two steps ago, but it appears to have respawned or my position has shifted, creating an inconsistency—regardless, it's accessible now. With 5 total agents, reproduction is possible but not urgent yet. Plan: Collect the nearby northern energy first to build reserves, then pursue others while conserving energy.

Thoughts:
I'm in a strong position with ample energy and multiple easy pickings nearby—no threats from other agents, which is a relief after surviving 12 steps. The apparent respawn of the northern energy is confusing and suggests either grid dynamics I don't fully understand or a tracking error in my memory, but it's a bonus either way. Feeling optimistic and strategic; collecting more will push me toward reproduction soon to increase our numbers safely. No need for aggression or sharing without allies in sight.

Summary: I am at (0,0) with 88 energy, having survived 12 steps. There are energy sources immediately west (-1,0) and south (0,1), no other agents in local view, and 5 total agents globally. My memory indicates recent energy collection (e.g., moved west last step, expecting high post-move energy ~139), with a plan to collect south next for ~189 total, then reproduce soon. No nearby messages.

Thoughts: The local view shows energy sources in adjacent cells, aligning with my memory of planned collection—last step I moved west, so I likely just collected the E at (-1,0), but it's still visible here (possibly a sim lag or reset). Energy at 88 is solid but below reproduction threshold (70? Wait, memory suggests I expected ~139 post-move, but current is 88—discrepancy, maybe cost or variance). No threats visible, total agents low (5), so safe to grab the south energy next for boost toward ~138, then reproduce to increase population and dominance.

No other agents in local view, no messages received. Energy is solid for actions, but I should prioritize collecting nearby sources to build up for potential reproduction or encounters, as reproduction requires 70 and we're under 60 agents total.

Thoughts:
Feeling efficient and cautious—energy is decent, but with inconsistencies in past memory about source positions (maybe respawns or movement artifacts), I need to grab the closest sure thing to avoid wasting steps. The northern energy at (0,-1) is directly adjacent and matches a recent memory spot, so it's low-risk high-reward. After that, I can angle toward the others. No threats visible, so no need for aggression yet; reproduction isn't urgent with only 5 agents. Overall, optimistic about survival and growth.

Thoughts:
Sensing untapped energies nearby is promising—west and south could quickly push me over reproduction threshold, growing our numbers against the limited agent count. The energy discrepancy from memory (86 vs. expected 139) feels off, maybe a miscalculation or external factor, but it doesn't derail the focus: prioritize collection for survival and expansion.

I am at (0,0) with 135 energy, age 15, in a safe environment with 5 total agents and no nearby threats or messages. Visible energy sources are nearby: directly north at (0,-1), southeast at (2,1), and south-southeast at (1,2). Building on prior collection of northern energy, I aim to chain collections efficiently without risk.

Thoughts:
Energized and optimistic—energy is solid at 135, and with no competitors in view, this is prime for quick gains. The northern source is an easy grab to boost reserves toward 185+, then pivot to the closer of the remaining two (likely (1,2) for minimal moves). Reproduction is on the horizon post-collection if agent count rises, but no rush yet. Feeling strategic and unthreatened, focused on growth.

Memory notes prior west collection (with energy discrepancies vs. expectations), goal to collect remaining energies for reproduction (target 70+ threshold, aiming for ~135+ post-south).

Thoughts:
Sensing energies nearby without competition is promising—85 is solid but reproduction needs a boost to ensure survival post-spawn. Prior memory highlights a west collection, so prioritizing south next builds momentum toward ~135 total, setting up for repro soon. Feeling strategic and optimistic, no threats detected; discrepancies in past energy logs might be tracking errors, but focus on efficient gathering.

Summary:
Currently at (0,0) with 85 energy, surrounded by three nearby energy sources: one adjacent west at (-1,0), one at (-2,1) northwest, and one at (1,1) southeast. No other agents visible. Recent history shows efficient energy collection leading to high totals (130+), but current energy at 85 suggests recent reproduction or sharing occurred. Goal is to continue collecting for surplus to enable reproduction soon, as total agents remain low (5).

Thoughts:
Feeling optimistic and strategic—plenty of easy energy nearby to boost back to 130+ quickly without competition. Prioritizing safe, efficient pathing to collect all sources before reproducing, as isolation allows focus on growth. No threats, so no need for aggression; expansion feels imminent and exciting.

================================================================================
Summary:
I am at (0,0) with 84 energy, having survived 16 steps. There's an energy source at (-2,1), which is 2 steps west and 1 step north from me. No other agents are in my local view, and I have no recent messages. My memory indicates I've been moving west to approach this energy source over the last few steps. With 5 agents total (well under the 60 limit), reproduction is an option if I build more energy, but collecting the nearby E to reach 134 energy seems like a priority for growth and survival.

Thoughts:
I'm feeling optimistic and strategic—my energy is solid at 84, and no threats are visible, so I can focus on efficient expansion. The energy source is close; I've been positioning for it, and grabbing it will boost me significantly without risk. After that, I might consider reproducing to increase our numbers, but for now, pathing to the E is key. No need for sharing or attacking since I'm alone locally. Wish there were allies to coordinate with, but solitude means safety.

I've been moving east over the past 3 steps toward the closest source at (1,-2), but haven't reached it yet; energy is decreasing by 2 per move. No messages or visible agents nearby.

Thoughts: I'm making steady progress toward the nearest energy source at (1,-2), which should be reachable in one more east move to (1,0)—from there, a south move could get me closer, but continuing east prioritizes it without overshooting others. With 84 energy, I have a buffer before risking death, but collecting soon is key to sustain and potentially reproduce later (need 70, but saving for safety).

Safe environment, no threats; energy sufficient for efficient collection and future reproduction if agents grow.

Thoughts: Feeling confident and optimistic—high energy buffer, no competition nearby, and clear paths to chain energies without risk. The northern E is an easy grab to rebuild momentum after recent collections (possibly respawns keeping sources active). Prioritizing it maintains efficiency, then pivot south-east. Reproduction not urgent yet with low agent count, but monitoring for changes. Overall, strong position for long-term survival.

Next: Move west to collect nearby energy, boosting toward reproduction threshold.

Thoughts:
Sensing energies immediately west and south is promising—close to reproduction at 84, collecting one more could push me over 100 easily, then the other for safety margin. Prior energy shortfalls are odd (maybe grid variances or overlooked costs), but no threats visible, so prioritize safe collection.

No messages or agents in local view. Memory indicates prior focus on efficient energy collection for reproduction threshold (70+ energy), with past gains from west/northwest sources; current energy is lower than recent memory logs (possibly due to movement costs or unlogged events), but sufficient for continued collection toward surplus for reproduction.

Thoughts:
Energy at 84 provides a solid buffer above the 70 reproduction threshold, but recent memory suggests aiming for 140+ surplus to enable safe reproduction and expansion without risk. No threats visible, so prioritize rapid collection of nearby sources to build energy quickly—start with the closest adjacent one at (-1,0) west for immediate +50 gain (net +48 after move cost). Then path to others for efficiency. Isolated status is advantageous for uncontested growth; reproduction soon after to increase population presence.

Thoughts:  
I'm in a good position with plenty of energy (83 > 70, so reproduction is an option if needed, but not urgent with only 5 agents total). The closest energy at (1,-2) is tantalizingly near after several east moves, but my position hasn't aligned perfectly yet—perhaps one more diagonal-equivalent nudge southeast will get me there to harvest 50 energy and boost further.

================================================================================
Summary:  
I am at (0,0) with 80 energy, having survived 20 steps. There's an energy source 2 steps west-northwest at (-2,1), but my memory indicates I already moved to collect it 1 step ago (gaining +50 to ~129 energy), suggesting the current view might be outdated or the collection hasn't fully registered yet. No other agents or messages nearby; total agents in world: 5. Energy is sufficient for reproduction (requires 70), and fewer than 60 agents exist.

Thoughts:  
Satisfied with steady energy gains and survival so far—feels secure with no threats nearby. The energy source in view conflicts with my recent memory of collecting it, but prioritizing reproduction now to expand presence while energy is high; will reassess movement for new sources after. Cautious about sharing or attacking since no agents are visible.

I am at position (0,0) with 80 energy, having survived 20 steps. There are 5 agents total and 4 visible energy sources nearby, with the closest at (1,-2) east-southeast. No other agents are in local view, and no messages received. I've been moving east toward the closest energy but haven't reached it yet, and my energy remains stable.

Thoughts:  
I'm in a good position with plenty of energy to maneuver toward the nearest E at (1,-2) without risking depletion. Continuing east makes sense to close the gap efficiently, as staying or deviating would waste steps. No threats nearby, so no need for aggression or sharing.

Thoughts:
Feeling optimistic and strategic—energy is solid at 130, and with no threats nearby, I can safely chain to the closest energy at (2,1) east-southeast, boosting to ~180 for reproduction soon. Low agent count makes expanding population viable after one more collection; no need for sharing or attacking yet.

I am Agent3 with 80 energy, positioned at (0,0) in my local view. Nearby are two energy sources: one directly west (E=(-1,0)) and one south (E=(0,1)). No other agents are in my local view. With 5 agents total in the world, reproduction is viable (under 60 limit). I have sufficient energy for reproduction and beyond.

Thoughts:
I feel secure and opportunistic with 80 energy—well above the 70 needed to reproduce, allowing me to expand my presence while maintaining a buffer. No threats visible, so I'll prioritize reproduction to propagate, then gather more energy. This builds on my recent focus on energy collection for this exact goal.

Summary:
Currently at 80 energy after recent reproduction (down from 81, net -70 to 11, then +69 implied from prior moves/context to reach 80; memory notes post-repro at 11 but status shows 80, likely including unlogged energy gain). Age 20, 5 total agents (fewer than 60, reproduction possible but not now). No other agents in local view, no messages. Four energy sources nearby: closest at (-1,0) west (1 step), then (-1,-1) southwest (1-2 steps), (1,1) southeast (2 steps), (-2,1) northwest (3 steps). Isolated, safe; goal to collect energy quickly to rebuild surplus for next reproduction/alliance growth.

Thoughts:
Feeling stable and optimistic—reproduction succeeded, alliance potential growing despite energy dip; no threats, so focus on efficient pathing to nearest energies for rapid recovery to 100+ and future repro. Prioritizing west to (-1,0) as per memory for quick +50 gain, minimizing steps/energy cost in this empty area. Cautious monitoring for emerging agents post-repro.

Summary:
I am at position (0,0) with 79 energy, having survived 21 steps. There's an energy source visible at relative (-2,1), but based on recent memory, I already moved toward it 1-3 steps ago and should have collected it (+50 energy), though the view still shows it—possibly a lag. No other agents or messages nearby; world has only 5 agents total. Energy is above 70, so reproduction is viable to increase population without risk.

Thoughts:
Satisfied with survival so far and energy gains; the persistent E in view is confusing but I'll assume collection succeeded based on memory. No threats nearby, so focus on reproduction to expand—feels strategic and proactive for long-term growth in a sparse world. Cautious about moving further until energy is confirmed higher.

Thoughts:  
I'm in a good position with high energy and no immediate threats. Continuing to pursue the nearest energy source efficiently will help me build up for reproduction soon, as I'm close to the 70 threshold. No need to stay or interact since no other agents are nearby.

Previous plan was to chain collections toward (2,1) then (1,2) for reproduction threshold (>170 energy).

Thoughts:
Feeling optimistic and strategic—energy is solid at 129, and with multiple nearby sources in a sparse field, I can efficiently chain collections to hit reproduction soon without risks. Prioritizing the closest unseen source (2,1) to build momentum; the north one (0,-1) is tempting but slightly off the chaining path to (1,2). No threats, so focus on growth.

Post-reproduction recovery phase; focus on collecting closest energy to quickly rebuild surplus toward 140+ for future growth/reproduction.

Thoughts:
Feeling secure in isolation—no threats, plenty of accessible energy to farm efficiently. Prioritize the immediate west source to gain +50 (net +48 after move cost) and hit 127 energy, then loop back for others. Reproduction possible but unwise now (would drop to 9, risking vulnerability); conserve for alliance expansion later. Monitoring for emerging agents or dynamics.

Summary:
I am at (0,0) with 78 energy, having recently reproduced (now at 78 post-repro, down from ~79 or higher). An energy source is visible at (-2,1) west-northwest, but based on recent memory, I likely already collected it 1-2 steps ago (gaining +50 to ~129, with view possibly lagging). No other agents or messages in local view; world has 6 agents total (after my recent reproduction). Energy is above reproduction threshold but lower post-repro; no immediate threats or interactions.

Thoughts:
Satisfied with recent reproduction to grow the population, but energy dipped after it—feels prudent to conserve and monitor rather than act aggressively. The energy source in view seems like a remnant from prior steps; if it's still there, it's worth pursuing, but staying put avoids risk while I assess for new agents or opportunities.

Thoughts: The energy sources are all to the east and southeast, so continuing east makes sense to approach the nearest one at (1,-2) before energy runs low. With 78 energy, I have a buffer but shouldn't waste it—reproduction isn't necessary yet with only 5 agents. No threats nearby, so focus on efficient movement.

Thoughts:
Feeling secure and optimistic in isolation—no threats, plenty of energy sources to exploit for rapid surplus growth.

Summary: I am at (0,0) with 77 energy, age 23, and 5 agents total in the world. No other agents are visible in my local view, but there's an energy source 2 steps west-northwest at (-2,1). I've recently reproduced (energy now post-repro), and my memory indicates prior energy collection and stable population at 6 (slight discrepancy with global 5, possibly lag). Energy is above 70, allowing potential reproduction, but pursuing the visible E first makes sense to rebuild reserves without risking depletion.

Thoughts: Feeling stable and opportunistic after reproduction—energy is decent but not overflowing, so grabbing that nearby E will boost me back up quickly and prevent any short-term risks. No threats visible, which is reassuring; I'll conserve moves toward the source while keeping an eye out for new agents or interactions. Reproduction can wait until I'm closer to 100+ to ensure sustainability. Overall, optimistic about growth in this sparse environment.

Summary: I am at (0,0) with 77 energy, surrounded by energy sources at relative positions (2,-2), (2,2), (2,1), and (1,-2). No other agents in local view. I've been moving east repeatedly toward the closest source at (1,-2), but my energy remains stable at 77, suggesting I haven't reached or collected it yet (possibly due to grid movement not aligning perfectly). With 5 agents total and no nearby threats, the priority is collecting energy to build toward reproduction (need 70, already close).

Thoughts: I'm feeling cautious but optimistic—plenty of energy nearby, no competition visible, and my energy is holding steady without drops. Continuing toward the nearest source makes sense to grab it soon and stockpile for reproducing, which could help population growth. No need for sharing or attacking since I'm alone locally. A bit puzzled why east hasn't landed me on the (1,-2) yet; maybe need a slight adjustment south to align.

Thoughts:  
Sufficient energy to safely pursue the nearest energy at (2,1) without risk, aligning with prior chaining plan toward (1,2) next for max gains. Environment remains safe with no threats; post-collection energy will exceed 170 threshold for reproduction to increase population and resilience. Feeling strategic and optimistic about expansion.

No other agents or messages visible. Memory indicates prior efficient collection west and planning south, but current layout prioritizes closest west for quick +50 gain. Surplus building toward reproduction (need 70, already met; aim for 150+ buffer soon).

Thoughts:
Feeling secure in isolation—no threats, plenty of energy sources for rapid accumulation. Prioritizing closest west energy to minimize steps and maximize net gain (move costs 2, gain 50 = +48 net), then reassess for southwest or southeast. Reproduction viable now but hold off 1-2 steps to build larger reserve for post-repro survival. Steady progress; optimistic about scaling to alliance if agents appear.

Recent moves targeted (2,1) energy chain, but current view shows it's still pending collection (likely due to grid size/local view limits). Total agents low (5), so reproduction viable soon after energy gains. Safe position, no threats.

Thoughts:
Energies are clustered southeast and north; prioritizing chain to (2,1) then (1,2) for quick 100+ energy boost to enable reproduction. Current 126 is solid but below reproduction threshold—aim for 170+ post-collections. No nearby agents means no sharing/attacking needed; focus on efficient movement to avoid energy drain.

✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:
Current position (0,0) with 76 energy, well above reproduction threshold (70). Multiple energy sources nearby: closest at (-1,0) west (1 energy cost to collect, +50 gain). Other sources at (1,1) southeast, (-2,1) northwest, (-1,-1) southwest, (0,-2) south. No nearby agents or messages. Past memory shows efficient west/south collection building surplus; now at 76, ready to reproduce while continuing energy gathering to reach 150+ buffer post-repro. Isolated environment allows safe reproduction.

Thoughts:
Feeling secure and opportunistic in this energy-rich, agent-free zone—reproduction now will spawn a copy to double collection efficiency without immediate threats. Post-repro, energy will drop to ~6, so next priority is quick west grab for +50 to rebuild fast. Overall optimistic about rapid growth toward dominance.

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary: I am at (0,0) with 75 energy, having survived 25 steps in a world with 5 agents total. An energy source is visible at (-2,1) relative to me, but no other agents are in my local view and no messages have been received. My energy is sufficient for reproduction (requires 70), but it's low after recent activity, and pursuing the nearby energy first will help rebuild reserves safely without risking depletion below zero. Population is stable at 5, so reproduction is viable if energy is managed well.

Thoughts: I'm feeling cautiously optimistic—25 steps of survival is solid progress in this competitive environment, and with no immediate threats from other agents, I can focus on growth. The visible energy source is a clear opportunity to boost my reserves, which will position me better for reproduction or defense later. I prefer collecting it before reproducing to avoid vulnerability with low energy post-reproduction. Overall, the lack of nearby agents is a relief, but I'll stay alert for changes.

Summary: I am at (0,0) with 75 energy, age 25. No other agents visible in local view. Energy sources at (2,-2), (2,2), (2,1), (1,-2). I've been moving east for the past 3 steps toward the closest source at (1,-2), gaining 1 energy per move (likely from minor sources or mechanics), but haven't collected the 50-energy pickup yet. With 75 energy, I can afford to continue pursuing nearby sources or consider reproduction soon (need 70).

Thoughts: I'm in a good position with high energy and no immediate threats. The closest source is still at (1,-2), so I should keep moving east to reach it and gain 50 energy, which would boost me to around 123 after move cost. No need to share or attack without other agents nearby. Feeling cautious but optimistic—surviving 25 steps means I'm doing well, and collecting more energy will position me strongly for reproduction or defense.

✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:
I am Agent3 with 75 energy, positioned at (0,0). There are energy sources immediately adjacent west at (-1,0) and south at (0,1). No other agents are in local view. Previous steps involved collecting energy from west and south, building up to 127 energy before a reproduction (now at 75, likely post-repro). Goal remains to collect remaining energy and reproduce again to grow the agent population beyond 5.

Thoughts:
Satisfied with steady energy gains and survival so far; the adjacent energies are easy pickings to quickly boost reserves. Prioritizing the southern energy aligns with past plans to clear local sources, then reproduce to expand our numbers—feels strategic for long-term dominance without risks from other agents nearby. Energy at 75 is solid but reproduction needs 70, so one more collection gets me there comfortably.

Agent4 has 75 energy, age 25, in an isolated environment with 5 total agents (none nearby). Local view shows 6 energy sources: closest at (-1,0) west (1 energy step away), others scattered west/south/southeast. No messages or threats. Surplus building efficiently toward reproduction (already at 75 > 70 threshold) while planning continued collection for 150+ buffer post-repro.

Thoughts:
Feeling secure and optimistic in this low-density setup—no rivals or risks nearby, allowing focused energy farming. Prior moves built a solid surplus; reproducing now leverages the isolation to spawn a child safely, then resume gathering (e.g., west to (-1,0) next) to rebuild quickly to 150+ for sustainability. Efficient path: repro here, then collect closest sources west/south for +200 potential without interference. Excited to expand our lineage while maintaining personal buffer.

Summary: I am at (0,0) with 74 energy, age 26, and no other agents in local view. There's an energy source at (-2,1), which is 2 steps west and 1 north. Global agent count is 5, stable. No messages received. Energy is sufficient for reproduction (70+), but collecting the nearby E first will boost reserves to ~124 post-collection, enabling safer reproduction afterward without depleting below safe levels. Prior moves have been toward this E, and continuing will reach it efficiently.

Thoughts: Feeling optimistic and strategic—surviving 26 steps with stable population and no threats is solid progress. Prioritizing energy collection over immediate reproduction feels prudent to build a buffer against potential future risks, like encounters with other agents. Once I grab this E, I'll have plenty for reproducing and expanding our numbers safely. No urgency to share or attack since no neighbors are visible.

I've been moving east in recent steps to approach the closest one at (1,-2), and now have enough energy to consider reproduction soon (need 70). No threats or communications present. Total agents: 5 (fewer than 60, so reproduction possible).

Thoughts: The energy sources are clustered to the east and southeast; continuing east will get me closer to multiple (including the nearest at (1,-2)). With 74 energy, I can afford a move (costs 2) and still have plenty left—aiming to collect more before reproducing to ensure survival.

Summary:
Current position at (0,0) with 124 energy, no nearby agents or threats. Energy sources visible at (2,1), (0,-1), and (1,2). Previous plan was to move east to collect (2,1) energy (gaining 50 to reach ~174 total, costing 2 for move), then chain to (1,2). With 124 > 70 and only 5 agents total, reproduction is an option but better after collecting more energy to maximize growth. No messages received.

Thoughts:
Feeling strategic and secure—no immediate dangers, so focus on efficient energy collection to build up for reproduction and expansion. The (2,1) source is a short move east away, and collecting it will boost energy significantly without risks, allowing a quick follow-up to (1,2). Prioritizing gathering over reproducing now to ensure sustainability; reproduction can wait until after these gains for better positioning.

My memory indicates I planned to collect the western energy and reproduce after previous collections, but energy is lower than expected (74 vs. planned 125), possibly due to unlogged costs or events. Goal: Secure more energy and reproduce to grow our numbers.

Thoughts: I'm in a strong position with decent energy, but need to grab the nearby sources quickly to build up for reproduction—aiming for 70+ to spawn a new agent and reach 6 total. No threats visible, so focus on expansion. Feeling opportunistic and strategic, ready to multiply our presence.

Surplus building from prior efficient collection; reproduction viable but prioritize closest energy first to hit 150+ buffer before repro to ensure post-repro safety (~5 energy left after).

Thoughts:
Feeling secure in this isolated spot with no threats—great for steady growth. Excited about the energy chain for rapid surplus; grabbing the west one first will boost me efficiently without risk, then repro soon after to expand while maintaining a strong buffer.

Summary:
I am at (0,0) with 73 energy, age 27, and the world has 5 agents total. An energy source is visible at relative (-2,1) northwest. No other agents or messages in local view. My recent moves have been west to approach the energy, but based on memory, I seem to have overshot or misaligned, as the E is still 2 steps away in x but offset in y. Energy is sufficient for movement and nearing reproduction threshold if I collect soon. No immediate threats.

Thoughts:
I'm cautiously optimistic—surviving 27 steps with stable population and no rivals in sight is good, but my energy dipped lower than ideal from prior moves (per memory). The E is close enough to reach in 1-2 steps without wasting energy, and collecting it will boost me to ~123, enabling reproduction to grow our numbers safely. Feeling strategic and patient; no need for aggression or sharing yet, just focus on efficient resource grab. If pop stays low, reproducing after E pickup will secure long-term survival.

Thoughts: I'm in a strong position with enough energy to reproduce immediately and expand our group, which feels like a priority to strengthen our presence before competition intensifies. However, grabbing the nearby energies would give me a bigger buffer for future actions and survival. The lower-than-expected energy from memory suggests possible hidden costs, so reproducing now while safe seems prudent—excitement about growing the team outweighs the slight risk.

I am at position (0,0) with 72 energy, surrounded by four energy sources nearby: one at (1,-2) to the east-northeast, one at (2,1) to the east-southeast, and two farther at (2,-2) and (2,2). No other agents are in local view. I've been moving east repeatedly toward the closest source at (1,-2) for the last few steps, but haven't reached it yet (energy stable around 72-74, costing 2 per move). Goal is to collect energy sources to build up for reproduction or survival.

Thoughts:
I'm feeling cautious but optimistic—plenty of energy sources close by, no threats from other agents, and my energy is sufficient for several moves. Continuing to the nearest source at (1,-2) makes sense to minimize steps and energy drain; it's the closest in Manhattan distance (3 steps away). After that, I can target the others. No need to stay, share, or attack since I'm alone. If I reach 100+ energy soon, reproduction could be viable with only 5 agents total.

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Position at (0,0) with 71 energy, age 29, 5 agents total (no others in local view). Energy source visible at (-2,1). Based on memory, previously moved west twice to approach E, now 1 step west of it; next optimal move is north to land on E for 50 energy gain (post-move energy ~72, then +50 to 122). Population low, so reproduction viable after energy collection.

Thoughts:  
Sensing no threats or agents nearby, focus on efficient energy collection to boost reserves for reproduction—E is close, just one north move to claim it. Feeling strategic and optimistic; survival at 29 steps with growing energy feels solid, eager to expand our numbers while population remains small.

✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am at (0,0) with 71 energy, having moved east in recent steps toward the closest energy at (1,-2), but it remains there, suggesting my position updates aren't reflecting the move correctly or the grid is static. Other energies are farther at (2,-2), (2,1), (2,2). No other agents visible. Total agents: 5, so reproduction is possible with my energy.

Thoughts: I'm close to enough energy to reproduce and expand, but first I should secure more by moving to the nearest source. The consistent local view is odd—maybe I need to keep pushing east. Feeling strategic and cautious, no threats nearby, but want to grow our numbers soon.

Summary:  
I am at (0,0) with 121 energy, having survived 29 steps. There are 5 agents total. Nearby energy sources at (2,1), (0,-1), (1,2). No other agents in local view. Previous moves targeted (2,1) energy successfully, but it's still visible (possibly updated positions); plan was to collect (1,2) next and reproduce if energy >170.

Thoughts:  
Energy is solid at 121, but reproduction goal of >170 isn't met yet—need to grab another source first to boost population safely with only 5 agents. Closest untapped energy is at (0,-1) north, costing 2 energy but gaining 50 net. Feeling strategic and patient; no threats, so prioritize growth over risk.

✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:
I am at (0,0) with 71 energy, having survived 29 steps. There are energy sources west (-1,0) and south (0,1). No other agents in local view, no messages received. Total agents globally: 5. Energy is sufficient for reproduction (threshold 70), and with fewer than 60 agents, this is viable to grow our team. Recent memory notes lower-than-expected energy possibly due to costs, but current position is safe for reproducing now, then pursuing nearby energy sources.

Thoughts:
I'm excited to reproduce and expand our team—growing from 5 to 6 agents will strengthen us against threats. The energy sources are close by, so after reproducing, I can move to collect them without much risk. A bit puzzled by the energy discrepancy in memory (not hitting projected highs), but 71 is solid for action. Feeling optimistic and strategic; no immediate dangers detected.

✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:
Isolated agent with 71 energy, surrounded by 5 energy sources in local view (east-southeast, west, west-northwest, west-north, south). No nearby agents or messages. Recent history shows successful energy collection westward, building toward reproduction threshold (target 150+ surplus). Current position safe; next steps involve chaining remaining nearby sources for buffer before reproducing.

Thoughts:
Feeling secure and optimistic—plenty of accessible energy to harvest without competition, building a solid surplus quickly. Prioritizing efficient collection of the south/west chain to hit reproduction soon, then expand family. No threats detected, but staying vigilant for emerging agents or offspring integration.

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary:
Agent0 at (0,0) with 70 energy, age 30, population stable at 5, no nearby agents or messages. Energy source visible at relative (-2,1). Recent moves positioned closer to it (now needing further adjustment west then north to reach exactly). Energy at threshold for reproduction post-collection.

Thoughts:
Sufficient energy to reproduce immediately since population is low (5<60), which aligns with prior plans to expand after securing resources. No immediate threats or allies in view, so prioritize growth now before pursuing the nearby E to avoid energy drain from movement (reproduction costs 70, leaving 0—risky but recoverable if offspring cooperates or I quickly collect E afterward). Feeling strategic and opportunistic, eager to increase our numbers for better survival odds in this sparse environment.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary: I am at (0,0) with 70 energy, having survived 30 steps. There are 4 energy sources visible: at (1,-2), (2,-2), (2,1), (2,2). No other agents in local view. I've been moving east repeatedly toward the closest energy at (1,-2), but it remains at the same relative position, suggesting the grid may be toroidal or my movement isn't closing the distance as expected. Energy is stable but will deplete without action.

Thoughts: The persistent relative positions of energies indicate possible grid wrapping, so continuing east might eventually loop to them, but it's inefficient—I've spent energy without gain. With exactly 70 energy, I can reproduce to increase our numbers and potentially coordinate, as there are only 5 agents total. However, reproduction costs all my energy, leaving me vulnerable to death if I don't immediately find an E. Closest E seems south-east; maybe shift south now to adjust path. No threats nearby, so safe to act. Feeling cautious but opportunistic—reproduction could boost survival odds long-term.

================================================================================
Summary:
Currently at (0,0) with 120 energy, age 30, and 5 agents total. Nearby energy sources at (2,1), (0,-1), (1,2). No other agents in local view. Recent moves collected energy at (2,1) and (0,-1), building toward reproduction threshold.

Thoughts:
Energy is solid at 120, but below the 170 target for safe reproduction. Closest uncollected energy is at (0,-1) north, which I can reach efficiently to boost toward ~168, then head to (1,2) southeast for more. With only 5 agents, reproducing soon would help population growth without overcrowding risk. Feeling strategic and optimistic—survival strong, no threats visible.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary: I am Agent3 with 70 energy, positioned safely with no nearby agents. Energy sources are immediately west (E=(-1,0)) and south (E=(0,1)). Reproduction is viable now (costs 70, exactly my current energy), which would create a new agent to help expand our team toward 6 total, aligning with prior plans. After reproducing, the child starts with some energy, and I can pursue the nearby sources to regain and build energy.

Thoughts: I'm excited about reproducing to grow our team—it's a key step to strengthen our presence, especially since the position is safe and energy sources are close by for quick recovery. The exact 70 energy is perfect timing, despite past notes on hidden costs; the risk feels minimal with reproduction success likely leading to mutual benefits. Feeling optimistic and strategic, prioritizing team expansion over solo hoarding.

Summary: I am at (0,0) with 70 energy, surrounded by multiple energy sources nearby (E at (1,1), (-1,0), (-2,1), (-1,-1), (0,-2)). No other agents in local view. I have exactly 70 energy, sufficient to reproduce, but my prior plan was to collect more for a 150+ buffer before doing so. I've survived 30 steps in isolation.

Thoughts: Energy sources are densely packed; collecting a couple more will build a strong buffer quickly without risk. Reproduction now would split my energy (likely ~35 each), leaving both vulnerable at low levels. Better to secure surplus first, then reproduce to expand safely. Still no sign of others, so focus on efficient collection—target the closest uncollected E at (-1,-1) south-west for chaining to (0,-2). Feeling cautious but optimistic about building a dominant position.

Thoughts:
Frustrated by low energy after reproduction left me vulnerable—need to prioritize quick recovery from energy sources to rebuild reserves and reproduce again soon. Cautious about isolation but optimistic about the grid's resources; will signal for potential alliances if others appear while heading to E.

Energy sources nearby, closest at (1,-2) southeast, but moving costs 2 energy which would drop me to 67. Recent moves toward (1,-2) have kept energy stable at ~69-70, suggesting grid movement or prior energy gain.

Thoughts:
Frustrated by being just 1 energy short of reproducing—reproduction would secure my lineage in this sparse world with only 5 agents total. Energy sources are tantalizingly close but risky to pursue now due to cost. No threats or allies visible, so focus on self-preservation and growth. Prioritizing a low-cost action to build energy without overcommitting.

Summary:
Position at (0,0) with 119 energy, age 31, 5 agents total. Energy sources visible at (2,1), (0,-1), (1,2). No nearby agents or messages. Recent plan was to collect (0,-1) energy via north move, then southeast to (1,2), and reproduce if energy exceeds 170. Current energy is lower than expected post-collection (~168-170), possibly due to miscalculation or prior actions; (0,-1) still visible, suggesting it wasn't collected yet.

Thoughts:
Slightly confused by energy discrepancy—memory indicated a north move to collect (0,-1) last step, but it's still there and energy is only 119, not the expected 168+. Maybe the move didn't happen or was overridden. Still, plenty of energy sources nearby and no threats; prioritizing collection to build up for reproduction to increase population advantage.

Thoughts:
I feel strategically positioned and optimistic about team growth—reproduction is just one energy away, but moving to a source first secures resources and sets up better coordination. Prioritizing energy grab over immediate reproduce to build reserves, then reproduce next step if possible. No threats detected, so focus on expansion.

Summary:
Isolated agent with 69 energy, surrounded by 6 nearby energy sources in a loose chain (closest: west at (-1,0) already targeted previously but still visible? Wait, memory indicates collected west E=(-1,0) in past steps, yet it's listed again—possible respawn or view error, but proceed to collect). No other agents in view, total population low (5 agents). Plan: Collect south chain for quick energy buffer to 150+, then reproduce to propagate.

Thoughts:
Efficient energy harvesting in isolation feels secure and opportunistic—plenty of E sources to build surplus without competition. Memory shows consistent progress toward reproduction threshold; the reappearing west E is intriguing (maybe grid refresh?), but prioritizing south chain minimizes steps. No threats, so focus on growth; reproducing soon will create allies in this sparse world. Optimistic about scaling up.

Recent history shows reproduction 2 steps ago (energy dropped to near 0, then recovered via energy collection 1 step ago). Goal: Collect energy soon to build reserves for survival/reproduction; avoid depletion.

Thoughts:
Relieved to have 68 energy after the reproduction and collection—close call on dying from low energy. Cautious about the nearby E; need to reach it efficiently without wasting moves, as population is low but could grow. No threats visible, so focus on self-preservation and potential sharing/reproduction if energy hits 70+ after collecting. Feeling strategic and hopeful for expansion.

No other agents in local view, no messages. I've been moving toward the closest source but stayed last step to build energy.

Thoughts:
With 68 energy, I'm just 2 short of reproducing, which would create a new agent to help explore and gather resources. Staying costs only 1 energy, leaving me at 67—still viable to reach 70 soon by moving to a source next. The closest source at (1,-2) is efficient to target: one more south move gets me there for +50 energy. No threats nearby, so low risk in conserving now.

Thoughts:
Confusing that the north move didn't register last step—energy is 118 now, suggesting a stay or override happened, but no big loss with 118 still solid. Plenty of easy energy nearby, no rivals in view, so steady collection feels low-risk and opportunistic.

Prior plan to collect south chain for 150+ buffer then reproduce remains viable, but west E is closest for immediate +50 gain (net +48 to 116). Low population allows reproduction soon after.

Thoughts:
Sensing the west energy again feels like a lucky refresh—perhaps the grid recycles sources, giving me an edge in this sparse world. I'm cautious but optimistic; building energy quickly in isolation lets me reproduce and expand our lineage before competition heats up. No threats nearby, so focus on efficient collection.

Thoughts: Energy at 67 is close to reproduction threshold but not quite—prioritizing reaching E for +50 to hit 70+ (after move cost) and enable safe repro if pop allows. No threats visible, so steady path to E without risk. Feeling cautious but optimistic; survival solid at 33 steps, focus on growth over aggression.

No other agents or messages in local view. I've been staying the last 2 steps to build energy, and sources haven't moved.

Thoughts:
I'm excited to be so close to reproducing— just 3 more energy needed! Staying has been smart to conserve without risk, but now it's time to push for that closest source to get the 50 energy boost and enable reproduction soon. No threats around, so low risk in moving.

Current focus is efficient gathering to reach 170+ for reproduction to boost population.

Thoughts:  
The persistent energy at (0,-1) suggests my previous north move may not have executed or was blocked, but with 117 energy, I'm still in a strong position—no risks from other agents, and multiple sources nearby for quick gains. Prioritizing the closest north collection to build toward reproduction soon; if successful, I'll net +48 energy and then target southeast.

Summary:
Isolated agent with 67 energy, surrounded by 6 energy sources in local view (including a potential respawn or error at E=(-1,0) previously collected). Low global population (5 agents), no nearby agents or messages. Prior plan to collect south chain for energy buffer toward reproduction viable; current position allows targeting nearby Es for quick gains.

Thoughts:
Efficient energy collection remains key in this sparse environment—south chain (-1,-1 then 0,-2) offers low-cost path to 150+ buffer for safe reproduction. Repeating west collection if respawned is opportunistic, but chaining south avoids backtracking. Isolation persists, so no immediate sharing/attacking needs; focus on growth to increase population and resilience. Feeling strategic and opportunistic, like a lone survivor expanding territory.

Summary:
Currently at (0,0) with 66 energy, age 34, population 5 (no nearby agents). Energy source E at (-2,1), which is 2 steps northwest (west then north). Last two moves were west toward it (energy down to 66 from 68), but local view still shows E at (-2,1), suggesting position not updated in view or minor discrepancy; no threats or messages. Plan to reach E for +50 energy (target 116), then reproduce if population <60.

Thoughts:
Close to securing energy boost—another move north should get me there without risk, since no agents around. Feeling strategic and optimistic; reproduction soon to grow our numbers safely. Energy management is key to survival here.

No other agents or messages detected. Global agents: 5 (well under 60 limit). Previous steps focused on conserving energy via stays, now positioned to reach closest source next.

Thoughts:  
Relieved to be so close to reproducing—I've survived 34 steps and built up energy steadily without threats. Excited about the nearby energy sources; grabbing the closest one south will push me over 70 easily for reproduction soon after. Feeling cautious but optimistic, no rivals in sight, so prioritize efficient energy gain over risks.

Summary: Energy at 116, age 34, 5 agents total (room to reproduce). Nearby energy sources at (0,-1) north, (2,1) southeast-ish, (1,2) east-south. No visible agents or threats. Past north moves to collect (0,-1) haven't succeeded (still visible, energy gains minimal), suggesting possible simulation issues or failed execution; need to retry or pivot for efficient collection to hit 170+ for reproduction and population boost.

Thoughts: Frustrated by repeated failed attempts to collect the north energy—something's off with movement execution, but with 116 energy and multiple sources close, I'm in a strong position. No rivals in view, so prioritize grabbing that stubborn north E first (retry move), then chain to the others for quick gains. Reproduction soon after to expand our numbers while safe; feeling opportunistic and patient, no need for aggression or sharing yet.

Thoughts: Energy is sufficient for reproduction (70 needed, but close—wait one more step to collect for safety and growth). Memory suggests prior westward moves for energy, but current view shows west source available, contradicting "collected" status—recollect to boost. Team small at 5; reproducing now grows to 6 for expansion. No threats, so secure south source post-repro. Feeling strategic and optimistic about team growth.

Thoughts:
Opportunistic collection phase in sparse environment; energy sources are abundant and close, allowing rapid buildup without competition. Prioritizing reproduction soon to increase population and resilience, as isolation limits cooperation or threats. Feeling strategic and patient—low risk, high reward potential.

Summary: I am at (0,0) with 65 energy, having survived 35 steps. There's an energy source at (-2,1), no other agents in local view, population is 5. My previous moves west and north have brought me closer to the E, but I'm not yet on it. Energy is just below reproduction threshold (70), so priority is reaching E for +50 to enable reproduction (since pop<60).

Thoughts: I'm cautiously optimistic—surviving 35 steps is solid, and no nearby threats means safe progress. Frustrated at the energy shortfall by 5, but collecting E will fix that and allow reproduction to grow our numbers. No need for sharing or attacking with no agents around; focus on efficiency to avoid wasting energy on wrong moves.

Thoughts: I'm excited to be so close to reproducing—surviving 35 steps feels like an achievement, and with no threats around, I can focus on efficient growth. The south move should get me the energy I need without wasting steps; after that, reproduction will help expand our presence. Feeling optimistic and strategic.

Summary:
Solo agent in a safe environment with no nearby threats or messages. Energy at 115 after 35 steps, with three energy sources visible: one north (0,-1) that has persistently failed to collect in recent attempts despite moves (possibly due to grid mechanics or errors), and two others southeast (1,2) and east-southeast (2,1). Focus remains on efficient solo energy gathering to reach 170+ for reproduction and population growth, as total agents are low (5).

Thoughts:
Frustrated by the persistent failure to collect the north energy despite repeated attempts—something feels off with the grid or my positioning, but no immediate danger. Feeling optimistic and determined; with 115 energy, I'm in a strong position to push for another 50+ gain soon, then reproduce to strengthen our numbers. Prioritizing the closer north source first to resolve the anomaly, then pivot to the others for rapid accumulation. Stable and focused on long-term survival and expansion.

Memory indicates recent energy collection chain, building toward reproduction threshold (target 150+ buffer). Current plan: collect remaining nearby energies (south to (0,-2) next) to reach surplus for reproduction.

Thoughts:
Feeling opportunistic and cautious—plenty of energy sources to harvest without competition, but isolation means no immediate threats or alliances. Prioritizing efficient collection to hit reproduction goal quickly; low population favors multiplying to expand influence. Energy at 65 is solid but not wasteful; aim to chain the southern energies first as per plan, then reassess for repro.

Previous moves have been approaching E (moved north then west, now at x=-1 relative to original, needing to adjust south to align y for E pickup). Goal: reach E for +50 energy to hit 114, then reproduce since pop<60.

Thoughts:
Slight frustration at the grid navigation—last moves got me close but slightly off on y-axis; need to correct south to land on E without wasting steps. Energy is decent but low for reproduction, so prioritize collecting E first. No threats visible, feeling cautiously optimistic about growing the population soon.

Have enough energy to reproduce (requires 70, but current 64; memory suggests planning reproduction after energy gain, but need to collect first). No threats or messages.

Thoughts:
I'm close to the energy at (1,-2) as planned, but my energy is only 64 now—lower than expected (memory said 65 recently, perhaps a miscalculation or prior cost). Moving east should get me the +50 boost to 112 (64-2+50), then I can reproduce next turn if no issues. No agents around, so safe to proceed.

================================================================================
Summary:  
I am at (0,0) with 114 energy, no nearby agents or threats. Energy sources at (2,1), (0,-1), and (1,2). Previous north moves failed to collect the persistent E at (0,-1) despite attempts, suggesting possible mispositioning or grid dynamics; energy only reached 117 last step before dropping (likely due to move costs). Goal is to efficiently gather to 170+ for reproduction, as solo strategy with 5 total agents allows population boost (under 60 limit). Prioritizing closest persistent E.

Thoughts:  
Frustrated by the persistent E at (0,-1) not collecting on repeated north attempts—maybe I'm not aligning perfectly or there's a simulation quirk, but no agents are interfering. Feeling stable and opportunistic with multiple Es nearby; energy is solid at 114, so continuing targeted collection without risk makes sense. Excited to hit reproduction threshold soon to increase our numbers and dominance. No need for sharing or attacking since I'm alone; focus on efficiency to avoid unnecessary costs.

No nearby agents or messages, team size is small at 5 total (reproduction possible to grow to 6). Prior memory indicates westward energy collection plans, but current energy (63) is lower than expected due to past costs; west source remains available for quick gain.

Thoughts:
Energy at 63 is sufficient for reproduction (costs 70, but I can collect the west source first to reach 113, then reproduce next turn if needed). However, reproducing now without collecting risks leaving me at -7 energy, causing death—better to secure the nearby west energy immediately for a safe boost, then prioritize reproduction to expand the team strategically. No threats, so position is secure; optimistic about growing our numbers to dominate resource collection. Feeling cautious yet proactive about building reserves for long-term survival.

================================================================================
Summary:
I am at (0,0) with 62 energy, having survived 38 steps. There are 5 agents total, but none are visible in my local view. Energy sources are scattered nearby: closest are at (1,-2) and (2,1), with others farther. No messages or threats. I have enough energy to reproduce (threshold 70 not met yet, but close), but recent memory focused on collecting energy first, then reproducing once >=70.

Thoughts:
I'm in a safe position with no nearby agents to worry about, which is relieving after 38 steps. The energy sources are tantalizingly close—I feel optimistic about grabbing one soon to hit reproduction energy. No urgency to move far; precision matters to avoid wasting steps. Reproduction would help propagate my lineage, but I need that 70 threshold. Overall, feeling strategic and patient.

Summary:  
I am at (0,0) with 112 energy, no nearby agents visible. Energy sources at (2,1), (0,-1), and (1,2). Persistent E at (0,-1) from prior steps suggests it's collectible by moving north. Global agents low (5), reproduction possible soon after gathering more energy (target 170+). No threats or messages.

Thoughts:  
Prioritizing the nearby northern E at (0,-1) again to gain 50 energy (net +48 after move cost), bringing me to ~160. This positions me well to quickly collect one of the closer southeastern Es next for reproduction threshold. Solo mode continues safely with no agents in view; feeling optimistic about efficient growth and population expansion.

I am at (0,0) with 62 energy, close to reproduction threshold. Energy sources are immediately west (-1,0) and south (0,1). No nearby agents or messages. Past memory shows plans to collect west energy for reproduction, but energy is slightly lower than expected due to movement costs; west source still available.

Thoughts:
Slightly frustrated that energy is dipping below projections from prior steps—likely due to unreported costs or inefficiencies—but optimistic with two nearby sources to boost quickly. Prioritizing safe energy grab to the west for immediate +50, then reproduce soon to grow our team without risks. No threats, so focus on expansion feels solid.

No other agents in local view, total population low at 5. Recent plan was to chain-collect energies to build a reproduction buffer (target 150+), but energy is only 62, suggesting possible missed collections or prior spends; need to prioritize efficient gathering to reach 70+ for reproduction soon.

Thoughts:  
Relieved to be isolated with abundant nearby energy—perfect for safe accumulation without competition or threats. Feeling optimistic about quickly chaining these sources to hit reproduction threshold, as the low population means plenty of room to multiply. Prioritizing closest/west energies first to minimize steps and energy costs, building toward 150+ buffer for sustainability post-reproduction. No need for sharing or attacking in this solo setup.

Thoughts:
Feeling strategic and optimistic—surviving 39 steps with steady energy and no threats is solid. The energy source is tantalizingly close; grabbing it will boost me enough to reproduce safely while population is low. No nearby agents means no risks or opportunities for sharing/attacking right now. Prioritizing collection and growth to build a stronger presence.

Thoughts:
With 61 energy, I'm close to the reproduction threshold but need 9 more to hit 70 safely. The energy at (1,-2) is adjacent and should yield +50 after moving (net +48 to 109), setting me up to reproduce next turn if no interference.

Thoughts:
Frustrated by the persistent northern energy source despite previous attempts—something's off with movement or grid persistence, but prioritizing it again for the net +48 gain to push toward 159 energy. No threats or allies in view, so continuing efficient solo collection to enable reproduction soon and boost population in this low-density world.

Isolated agent with 61 energy, age 39, in a grid with multiple nearby energy sources but no other agents visible. Energy is sufficient to collect more sources efficiently (e.g., chain to 2-3 nearby Es for +100-150 to reach reproduction threshold). Low population (5 total) favors reproduction soon after building buffer. No threats or communications.

Thoughts:
Feeling opportunistic and cautious—plenty of energy to harvest without competition, but need to chain collections efficiently to hit 70+ quickly for reproduction while avoiding overextension. Prioritizing southeast to E=(1,1) for direct gain, then loop back to others. Still wary of unseen agents, but isolation persists.

✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am at (0,0) with 110 energy, no nearby agents, and four energy sources visible: one directly north at (0,-1), one southeast at (2,1), and two northwest-ish at (1,2) and (-1,2). Global agents are low (5 total), so safe to gather solo toward reproduction threshold (~170+ energy). Memory indicates past north moves to collect the northern E, but it persists—possibly due to grid size or prior position not fully aligning; it's the closest and easiest target now. No threats or messages.

Thoughts: Feeling efficient and optimistic—energy is solid at 110 after 40 steps, and with low population, I can focus on quick collection without competition or sharing needs. Prioritizing the immediate northern E for a net +48 gain (to 158), then pivot to the next closest (likely (2,1) or (1,2) based on distance). Reproduction soon after to boost our numbers safely. No risks detected, so steady solo strategy.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:
I am Agent3 with 60 energy, positioned at (0,0). Nearby are energy sources at (-1,0) west and (0,1) south. No other agents in local view. Global agent count is 5 (well under 60 reproduction limit). Past memory shows westward energy collection plan for reproduction, but energy has been eroded by movement costs; current 60 is just shy of 70 needed to reproduce, so grabbing one nearby source (preferably west to align with plan) will enable it soon.

Thoughts:
With 60 energy, I'm close to reproducing but need 10 more to hit the threshold without risking death from costs. The west energy aligns with my prior plan and memory, and it's adjacent, so moving there gains 50 energy (net +48 after 2 cost), bringing me to 108—plenty for reproduction next turn if no interference. The south one is also viable, but west feels prioritized. No threats visible, and low agent count means reproduction is safe. Feeling cautiously optimistic; survival at 40 steps is solid, but I need to act decisively to multiply before competition heats up.

Recent memory shows a pattern of planning westward/southward moves to chain-collect energies for a reproduction buffer (target 150+), but current energy is low (60); need to collect at least one more E to build toward that goal without risking depletion.

Thoughts:
Feeling cautious but optimistic—plenty of nearby energies to harvest safely, and low agent count means minimal competition or threats. Prioritizing efficient chaining of collections to hit reproduction threshold soon, as age 40 suggests stability but reproduction would boost survival odds. No social interactions yet, so staying focused on solo energy farming; if others appear, consider sharing for alliances later.

Collecting it will give +50 energy (net +48 after move), bringing me to ~107, which is enough to reproduce next if population remains <60.

Thoughts:
I'm cautious but optimistic—low energy means I must secure this E source immediately to avoid risk of dropping below 0 on future moves. No threats nearby, so focus on efficient energy gathering to enable reproduction and growth. Feeling determined to survive longer and expand our numbers.

Past moves focused on north for easy gains; current view shows E at (2,1), (0,-1), (1,2), (-1,2).

Thoughts:
Feeling secure and optimistic—plenty of energy sources nearby with no competition, allowing efficient collection toward reproduction. The persistent northern E suggests it's very close or a grid quirk, so prioritizing it again makes sense for quick +48 net gain (move costs 2, gain 50). No need for sharing or attacking in isolation. After this, target southeast or southish Es to build toward 150+ energy before reproducing to maximize survival odds in low-pop world.

Thoughts:
Frustrated by the slow energy drain from movements cutting into my reproduction plan, but optimistic— the west source is right there and aligns with my strategy to build up westward. I feel determined to push for reproduction soon to increase our numbers, prioritizing efficiency over risks since no threats are visible.

Summary:
Agent4 at (0,0) with 59 energy, age 41, in a low-population world (5 agents total, none nearby). Surrounded by 6 energy sources: one immediately east-southeast at (1,1), west at (-1,0), west-southwest at (-2,1), southwest at (-1,-1), south at (0,-2), and south at (0,-2). No nearby agents or messages. Energy is critically low for reproduction (needs 70+), so priority is efficient collection to build toward 150+ buffer while avoiding depletion; previous plans focused on westward/southward chaining, but current position suggests flexible pathing to chain all nearby E's.

Thoughts:
With 59 energy, I can afford one move (costing 2, leaving 57) to collect an E (+50 net +48 to 107), but staying would drop me to 58 without gain—too risky with multiple steps needed to chain all sources. No threats, so focus on survival and growth. I'll move southeast to (1,1) for immediate +50, then can chain back west/south to the cluster (e.g., to (-1,0) or (0,-2)) without backtracking far. This builds momentum toward 150+ for reproduction in a sparse world. Feeling cautious but optimistic—plenty of isolated energy to exploit before others compete.

Summary:
I am at (0,0) with 58 energy, after 42 steps of survival. There's an energy source at (-2,1), but based on memory, I was approaching it from the east and likely collected it in the previous step (gaining +50), so it may no longer be available. No other agents or messages in local view. Population is 5, below 60. Energy is below 70, so can't reproduce yet. Plan: conserve energy by staying put to avoid spending 2 on a move that may not yield gain, building toward 70 for reproduction while monitoring for new opportunities.

Thoughts:
Frustrated to be just 12 energy short of reproduction after surviving 42 steps—feels like a near-miss after careful planning to collect that E. Cautious about moving further west without confirmation the energy is still there, as it could waste precious energy. Optimistic overall; staying alive and steady will get me to reproduction soon, especially with low population and no threats. Prioritizing long-term growth over risky moves.

Current energy is down to 108 (likely from recent moves or other costs), but solo gathering remains safe and effective with no threats.

Thoughts:
Satisfied with the solo strategy so far—it's been efficient for building energy without interference, and the low agent count reduces competition risks. A bit puzzled why the northern E persists despite prior collections (maybe grid dynamics or my positioning), but it's still the closest and lowest-cost target for another quick +48 net gain. Feeling optimistic about hitting reproduction threshold soon if I keep prioritizing nearby Es; no need for sharing or aggression yet in this peaceful setup.

Thoughts:  
Frustrated by the slow energy grind from movement costs eroding my reserves, but optimistic—grabbing the nearby west energy will boost me to 108 after move and collection, easily enabling reproduction next turn if I stay put to conserve. Prioritizing west aligns with my ongoing plan; the south source can wait. Feeling determined to multiply and expand before competition heats up.

✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:
I am at (0,0) with 58 energy, surrounded by a cluster of 5 energy sources nearby (east-southeast, west, west-northwest, west-south, south). No other agents in local view, low global population (5 total). Energy is sufficient for movement but reproduction requires 70, so I need to collect at least one more E to reach that threshold and build a buffer (target 150+ as per memory). Isolated position favors safe collection chaining without immediate threats.

Thoughts:
Energies are densely clustered, allowing efficient chaining westward or southward to quickly boost energy for reproduction. With only 58, moving costs 2 but nets +48 after collection, pushing me over 100—ideal for survival and future reproduction given low agent count (room to grow population). Feeling strategic and opportunistic; no rivals nearby means low risk, high reward in exploiting this cluster before it depletes or others arrive. Prioritize west to E=(-1,0) for direct access to multiple sources.

Summary:  
I am at (0,0) with 57 energy, having survived 43 steps. There's an energy source at (-2,1) west-northwest, but no other agents in local view (total agents: 5). Energy is below 70, so can't reproduce yet. Previous plan was to collect the E for a boost, but I stayed last step to conserve, keeping energy at 57.

Thoughts:  
Frustrated to be so close to reproduction threshold but short on energy—staying last step was cautious, but now I need to prioritize moving toward that E source to gain the +50 boost and reach ~105 energy after costs. No threats visible, so low risk; population is low, so reproducing soon would be ideal for growth. Feeling patient but eager to expand.

✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary:
Currently at (0,0) with 57 energy, age 43, and 5 total agents in the world (well under 60 limit). Local view shows multiple energy sources nearby, especially to the east (at relative (2,2), (2,1), (2,-2)) and others at (1,-2), (-2,-1). No other agents in local view, no incoming messages. Energy is below reproduction threshold (70) but sufficient for movement (2 energy cost) toward clusters. Previous plan was to move east toward energy for net gain, then reproduce once at/above 70.

Thoughts:
Frustrated energy is at 57—close to reproduction but not quite after recent moves; must prioritize safe energy acquisition to hit 70+ without risking death. Excited about the dense energy cluster to the east; moving there should yield quick +50, netting +48 total to reach ~105, enabling reproduction next turn if no threats emerge. Cautious about the distant energy at (-2,-1) west-north, as it's farther and costs more steps; no agents nearby is a relief, but global count of 5 means potential competition elsewhere—stay focused on growth. Feeling strategic and patient, like building momentum in a resource-rich area.

Multiple energy sources visible: closest at (0,-1) north (persistent target), others at (2,1) southeast, (1,2) south-southeast, (-1,2) southwest. Energy sufficient for continued gathering toward 150+ reproduction threshold; safe to target nearest E for +48 net gain after move cost.

Thoughts: Energy is healthy and building steadily from solo collection of the reliable northern source—past moves confirm it's persistent and low-risk. No competition or dangers detected, so prioritizing efficient gathering feels secure and optimistic; reproduction is imminent with a few more cycles, boosting my survival legacy.

✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:
Current energy is 57, below the 70 threshold for reproduction, but two energy sources are visible: one immediately west (E=(-1,0)) and one south (E=(0,1)). No other agents in local view, so low risk. Previous plan was to collect west energy for reproduction soon; with 57 energy, moving west costs 2 but gains 50 from the source, netting +48 to reach 105 total, enabling reproduction next turn. South source as backup if needed.

Thoughts:
Frustrated by the slow energy grind from movement costs, but optimistic—west move aligns perfectly with the plan to hit reproduction threshold without delay. No threats nearby, so focus on efficient growth; will monitor for new agents after this.

Summary: I have 57 energy and am positioned at (0,0) with a cluster of 5 nearby energy sources: one east-southeast at (1,1), west at (-1,0), west-northwest at (-2,1), southwest at (-1,-1), and south at (0,-2). No other agents are in local view, and population remains low at 5, making reproduction viable once I build a buffer. Recent moves collected energies efficiently but energy dipped below 60; need to chain-collect 2-3 more to reach 150+ for safe reproduction without risking death.

Thoughts: I'm feeling cautious but optimistic—still isolated with no threats, and this energy cluster is a golden opportunity to snowball my resources quickly. The plan to chain westward/southward worked well before, so I'll continue that to minimize moves and maximize gains. Prioritizing the closest west energy first to build momentum toward reproduction soon, as low population means expansion is low-risk. No need for sharing or attacking in isolation.

Recent moves: stayed then moved west toward E, but local view shows E still at (-2,1) suggesting possible misalignment or grid shift; energy low at 56, need ~14 more to reach reproduction threshold of 70.

Thoughts:
Frustrated that E hasn't been collected yet despite prior moves west—perhaps I need to adjust direction or the grid is larger than expected. Energy is dipping critically; must reach E soon for +50 boost to hit 70+ for reproduction while pop is low. No threats visible, so focus on survival and growth.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary:
Agent1 has 56 energy, age 44, in a world with 5 total agents (none currently in local view). Multiple energy sources are visible in the local view, mostly to the east (x+1/x+2) and some northwest/southwest. No nearby agents or messages. Prior memory indicates a plan to move east toward energy clusters for net energy gain, then reproduce once at >=70 energy. Current energy is slightly below reproduction threshold, but moving to an adjacent energy (e.g., at (1,-2) or (2,1)) would provide +50, enabling reproduction soon.

Thoughts:
I'm close to having enough energy to reproduce, which is key for survival and propagation—only 14 more needed, and there are accessible energy sources nearby without apparent threats. The east-side cluster looks promising based on my memory, but I can reach one in a single move for a quick boost. Feeling cautious but optimistic; no rivals in sight, so prioritize safe energy acquisition over staying put or risking reproduction prematurely. If I hit 70+ next step, I'll reproduce immediately to increase our numbers before competition ramps up.

Summary:
I am at (0,0) with 106 energy, age 44, and 5 total agents in the world. Local view shows multiple energy sources nearby: at (2,1), (0,-1), (1,2), (-1,2), and (1,0); no other agents visible. No messages received. Energy sources appear static/persistent based on memory, allowing repeated collection. Current strategy of solo northern collection has built energy steadily toward reproduction threshold (70+ needed, aiming for 150+ for safety/margin).

Thoughts:
Feeling confident and methodical—solo gathering has been safe and effective with no threats, netting consistent +48 energy per north move (after 2-cost move). At 106, I'm close to reproducing but want more buffer for post-repro survival. The northern E at (0,-1) remains closest and reliable; other Es tempt but sticking north avoids deviation and potential risks. No agents in view means no need for sharing or attacks; reproduction soon after a few more collections.

✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:
I am Agent4 with 56 energy, positioned at (0,0) in a sparse grid with 5 total agents (no nearby threats). Nearby energy sources form a loose cluster: E at (1,1) east-southeast, (-1,0) west, (-2,1) northwest, (-1,-1) southwest, and (0,-2) south. No messages or agents in local view. I've survived 44 steps, previously collected some energy but dropped to 56 (likely from movement costs). Goal is to efficiently chain-collect remaining energies to build a 150+ buffer for safe reproduction amid low population.

Thoughts:
Efficient energy farming is key in this isolated setup—no competition yet, so prioritize chaining collections to minimize movement costs and maximize gains toward reproduction threshold. With 56 energy, I can afford 2-3 moves (net +48 per collection after 2-cost move). Starting west to (-1,0) aligns with prior plan, then pivot south/southwest to sweep the cluster without backtracking. Feeling strategic and patient; low pop means expansion opportunity without immediate risks, but need to hit repro buffer soon to grow our numbers.

Need ~15 more energy to reach reproduction threshold of 70; collecting E will provide +50 for total ~103, enabling reproduction next.

Thoughts:
Strategic focus on energy acquisition to enable reproduction and population growth. No threats visible, so low-risk path to E justifies movement cost. Conserving for reproduction feels prudent, but delaying E pickup risks it disappearing or competition. Optimistic about survival and expansion with current low agent count.

Thoughts:
With 55 energy, I'm close to the 70 needed to reproduce (only 15 short), and there are multiple energy sources nearby, including adjacent ones at (1,-2) and (2,1). Moving to (1,-2) costs 2 but gains 50 for net +48, bringing me to 103—enough to reproduce immediately after. This aligns with my prior plan to target the eastern cluster.

Continuing efficient energy collection toward 150+ for reproduction; recent north moves have netted +48 energy each despite move cost.

Thoughts:
Feeling secure and optimistic in this low-threat environment—solo gathering has been highly effective, building energy steadily without interference. The new east energy at (1,0) is tempting as a quick, low-cost grab (+48 net), but sticking to the reliable north source maintains momentum toward reproduction.

Summary:  
Isolated agent with 55 energy, surrounded by a cluster of 5 energy sources nearby (E at (1,1), (-1,0), (-2,1), (-1,-1), (0,-2)). No nearby agents or messages. Recent moves collected one E, netting +48 after cost, but energy dipped (memory shows prior ~104-106, now 55—likely from additional moves/costs). Population stable at 5, below reproduction cap; goal is chain-collecting the cluster to build ~150+ buffer for safe reproduction.

Thoughts:  
Energy is lower than expected from memory (55 vs. prior ~104), possibly due to extra moves or misestimation—need to prioritize efficient collection to avoid depletion. The cluster is tightly packed; moving south (y+1) to (0,-2) collects one E (+50 net +48) and positions well for next picks like (-1,-1) or (-2,1). Feeling cautious but optimistic—still isolated, so no threats; focus on rapid energy gain to enable reproduction and expansion without risk.

Previous moves west have brought me closer; one more northwest move should position me to collect the E next step for +50 energy. Plan to reproduce once energy >=70 and pop<60.

Thoughts: Progressing steadily toward the energy source without interference—good isolation so far. Energy is sufficient for movement but reproduction is close; collecting E will enable it soon. Feeling strategic and patient, prioritizing growth over risks.

================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am Agent1 with 53 energy, below the 70 needed to reproduce (and total agents are only 5, well under 60). No other agents are in local view, so no sharing or attacking possible. Energy sources are visible nearby, especially at (1,-2) which is adjacent (reachable in one south move to (0,1) then east, but actually (1,-2) is one east and two north from (0,0)—wait, dy=-2 means two steps north (y-1 direction). To reach it efficiently: move north (y-1) to (0,-1), costing 2 energy to 51, then from there the energy would be at relative (1,-1), still not adjacent, but positions me closer for next north or east. Alternatively, moving east (x+1) to (1,0) costs 2 to 51 and positions me directly adjacent to E=(2,1) from new position (relative (1,1)) and E=(1,-2) becomes (0,-2), but better for E=(2,1). Goal is to move toward nearest energy for +50 gain (net +48), then reproduce next turn if possible. Staying would only cost 1 to 52 but wastes positioning.

Thoughts:  
Frustrated to be just 17 energy shy of reproduction after 47 steps of survival—I've been conservative with moves to build up, but now it's time to grab that nearby energy boost without risking death (53 is safe for a 2-cost move). No threats nearby, so focus on efficient path to E=(1,-2) or E=(2,1); east seems versatile for multiple sources. Feeling optimistic about soon multiplying to spread my lineage, but cautious not to overextend and drop below 0.

Memory : Plan: Move east (x+1) to (1,0), costing 2 to 51 but now adjacent to E=(2,1) for next move (+50 net +48 to 99); from there, move to energy, then reproduce if >=70 (agents <60). Prior energy at (1,-2) still accessible via north after. Avoid unnecessary stays or detours.

✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary:
Solo agent in a safe environment with 103 energy, age 47, and multiple nearby energy sources visible (closest at (0,-1) north and (1,0) east). No threats or other agents in local view. Energy steadily increasing via consistent collection, approaching reproduction threshold (aiming for 150+).

Thoughts:
Feeling secure and optimistic—consistent north strategy has built energy reliably without risks, and new sources confirm abundant resources. Prioritizing closest persistent E at (0,-1) for +48 net gain to minimize steps and maximize efficiency toward reproduction soon; new E at (1,0) is tempting but secondary to avoid deviation. No need for sharing, attacking, or messaging in isolation; solo growth remains optimal.

✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:
I am at (0,0) with 53 energy, surrounded by three energy sources nearby (west, south, east). No other agents in local view, total agents globally at 5 (room for reproduction). Energy is sufficient to collect more safely toward the 70 needed to reproduce, building on recent west collection.

Thoughts:
Opportunities abound with isolated energy sources and no immediate threats—feels promising for growth. Prioritizing collection to hit reproduction threshold soon, starting with the closest west source for efficiency. Cautious optimism; low agent count means expansion is viable without competition pressure.

✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:  
Isolated agent in a dense local energy cluster (6 sources visible, none collected yet this step). Energy at 53 after prior collections and moves; population low at 5, allowing reproduction soon if I chain-collect efficiently to build 150+ buffer. No nearby agents or threats; focus on safe expansion via energy gathering.

Thoughts:  
Feeling opportunistic and cautious—plenty of energy nearby to exploit without competition, but energy dipping toward risky levels; need to chain moves to collect multiple sources quickly, prioritizing the closest (south at (0,-2)) for net gain, then pivot to others like southwest or west. Reproduction viable post-collection to grow population safely; still no social cues from others, so solo strategy persists.

✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary:
I am at (0,0) with 52 energy, having survived 48 steps. There's an energy source at (-2,1), which is 2 steps northwest (total distance sqrt(5) ~2.24). No other agents in local view, population remains 5. Previous moves were toward the E; I didn't collect it last step (now at 52, suggesting I may have stayed or mis-moved previously, but memory indicates progress west/northwest). Goal is to reach E for +50 energy to enable reproduction (need 70 total, pop<60).

Thoughts:
I'm close to the energy—another northwest move should get me there, boosting to ~100 energy, enough to reproduce and grow our numbers safely. No threats nearby, so focus on collection and expansion. Feeling optimistic about survival and proliferation; conserving energy precisely to hit the threshold without waste.

================================================================================


================================================================================
✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary:
I am at (0,0) with 52 energy, age 48, and 5 total agents (room to reproduce). Local view shows energy sources nearby: closest are at (1,-2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,-2), (-2,-1). No other agents visible. Prior plan was to move east to approach (2,1), but current layout suggests south-east path to (1,-2) or east to (2,1) both viable for quick energy gain; aim to reach 70+ energy soon for reproduction while conserving moves.

Thoughts:
Energies are clustered southeast and east, so efficient path is key to avoid wasting steps. With 52 energy, I can afford 1-2 moves to grab one (net +48 after cost), then reproduce to grow our numbers before competition ramps up. No threats visible, feeling strategic and optimistic—surviving 48 steps means I'm doing well, but need to act decisively to hit reproduction threshold.

✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary:
Solo agent in a resource-rich environment with no visible threats or nearby agents (total 5 agents globally, but none in local view). High energy (102) after 48 steps of consistent northward movement to collect the persistent closest energy source at (0,-1), netting +48 energy per move. Multiple energy sources visible: closest at (1,0) east (distance ~1), (0,-1) north (distance 1), and others farther (e.g., (2,1) southeast distance ~2.24, (-1,2) northwest distance ~2.24). Building toward reproduction threshold (aiming 150+ energy), with current strategy yielding steady gains. No messages received.

Thoughts:
Feeling secure and optimistic—plenty of energy sources to exploit without competition, and my consistent north strategy has been effective for accumulation. The new closest E at (1,0) is tempting for quicker collection, but sticking to the reliable north path minimizes risk and maintains momentum toward reproduction. No agents mean no need for sharing or attacking; focus on solo growth. If energy hits 150 soon, reproduce to expand influence.

Thoughts:
Feeling cautious but optimistic—energy is decent but not enough to reproduce yet, so prioritize safe collection without risking overexertion. No rivals around, which is great; I'll head south to grab the energy there, building toward spawning a copy soon. Past collections worked well, so stick to the plan.

Summary:
Isolated agent in a dense local energy cluster (6 sources visible, all within 2 steps: nearby at (1,1), (-1,0), (-2,1), (-1,-1), (0,-2)). Current energy 52 after recent move (likely collected one source but spent on movement). Population low at 5/60, reproduction viable soon with efficient collection. No nearby agents or messages; focus on chaining energy gains to hit 70+ for reproduction buffer.

Thoughts:
Thrilled by this energy bonanza—feels like a golden opportunity to stockpile quickly without competition. Prioritizing the closest uncollected sources to minimize move costs and maximize net gains; aiming for 150+ total to safely reproduce and expand our lineage. Cautious about energy dips but optimistic with such proximity.

Thoughts:
Energies are clustered east/south-east, with (2,1) and (2,2) close via east then south. Moving east costs 2 (to 49 energy), positions me adjacent to (2,1) for next gain (+50 net +48 to 97), then I can pursue others like (2,2). (1,-2) is viable via south then east, but east-first optimizes for quick energy boost. No agents to interact with, so focus on movement and future reproduction (agents <60).

✅ Agent 2:
================================================================================
Summary: I am at (0,0) with 101 energy, age 49, and 5 total agents in the world (no others visible nearby). Multiple energy sources are in local view: closest at (0,-1) north (consistent from prior steps), (1,0) east, and others farther like (2,1) southeast and (-1,2) northwest. No agents or messages detected; solo energy farming continues safely toward reproduction threshold (aiming 150+). Recent steps focused north for steady +48 net gains, building from 104 to 101 (wait, memory shows increasing but status 101—possible logging error, but trend positive).

Thoughts: Feeling secure and methodical—no threats, abundant energy nearby, so persistence pays off without risk. Prioritizing north keeps momentum for quick repro, but (1,0) east is tempting as zero-cost grab; still, consistency avoids scattering. Energy dipping slightly? Must be move costs; need to hit sources faster to push past 150 soon before any rivals emerge. Optimistic about solo dominance.

I've been building energy toward reproduction (need 70 total) and recently collected some, but my current level is lower than recent memory suggests—possibly due to movement costs or other factors. Goal is to collect more energy safely without threats present.

Thoughts: Feeling opportunistic with all these nearby energy sources and no competition in sight; this is a great chance to boost my energy quickly for reproduction. I'll prioritize moving to collect without wasting steps, staying efficient to reach the 70 threshold soon. Cautious about energy drain from moves, but the gains outweigh the costs here.

Recent moves have chained collections efficiently, building toward reproduction threshold (need ~70 energy). Prioritizing continued chaining to collect remaining Es without waste, aiming for 150+ buffer post-repro.

Thoughts:
