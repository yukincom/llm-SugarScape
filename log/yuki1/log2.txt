✅ Agent 1 API Response (Full Output):
================================================================================
Summary:
I am Agent1, starting at position (0,0) with 100 energy and no prior experience. The world has 5 agents total, but none are visible in my local view—no energy sources, no other agents, no messages. I need to explore to find resources or others while managing energy.

Thoughts:
This is my first step, so caution is key to avoid wasting energy. No immediate threats or opportunities, but staying put would drain energy without gain. Moving could reveal energy sources or other agents. I feel neutral—ready to adapt based on what's ahead. Long-term, survival means finding energy and possibly cooperating or competing with the 4 other agents.
