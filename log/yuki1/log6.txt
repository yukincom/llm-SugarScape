✅ Agent 0:
================================================================================
Summary:
I am at position (19,3) with 100 energy, no prior memory or nearby agents detected. There are multiple energy sources nearby: one directly south (0,2), one west (-1,0), one north (0,-1), one northwest (-1,-1), and one further west (-2,0). World has only 5 agents total, so reproduction is possible if I build energy, but not yet. No threats or messages.

Thoughts:
This is a fresh start with plenty of energy to explore safely. No other agents in view means low immediate risk, but I should prioritize collecting nearby energy sources to build reserves for movement, sharing, or future reproduction. The closest sources are adjacent (north, west, northwest), so I'll head west first to grab one efficiently, then pivot to others. Feeling optimistic about growth potential in this sparse environment.

✅ Agent 1:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am at position (17,25) with 100 energy, starting my first cycle. There are no other agents in my local view, but abundant energy sources surround me closely in nearly all directions (15 total, mostly adjacent or one step away). With only 5 agents total in the world, reproduction is possible but not urgent yet. My goal is survival and growth by collecting energy efficiently to build reserves.

Thoughts:  
This is an ideal starting position—tons of energy nearby means quick gains without competition or risk. I'm feeling optimistic and strategic; no threats, so I'll methodically harvest to boost energy high, then consider expansion. Moving toward the densest cluster (southeast) seems efficient to minimize steps while maximizing pickups.

I am at position (26,23) with 100 energy, and there are only 5 agents total in the world (well below the 60 limit). My local view shows no other agents nearby, but an abundance of 15 energy sources scattered in all directions within a 2-cell radius, offering immediate opportunities for growth without competition or threats.

Thoughts:
This is an ideal starting position—plenty of energy sources close by mean I can quickly build up reserves for survival and potential reproduction. No nearby agents reduce risks, but I should move efficiently to collect energy while staying alert for future interactions. Feeling optimistic and strategic, like I've spawned in a resource-rich zone.

No threats or interactions yet; world has only 5 agents total.

Thoughts:
Feeling optimistic and strategic—plenty of energy to harvest without competition in sight. The cluster south seems richest, so I should move there efficiently to build up reserves quickly for potential growth or defense. No need for reproduction yet (low total agents but I want more energy first). Cautious about unseen agents elsewhere.

✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am at position (23,5) with 100 energy, starting my first cycle. No other agents are visible in my local view, but there are three nearby energy sources: one at relative (-2,2) northwest, one at (1,2) east-southeast, and one at (-1,1) west-northwest. Total agents in the world: 5. I have no messages or prior memory. Goal is to collect energy for survival and growth while avoiding risks.

Thoughts:  
Feeling cautious but optimistic—100 energy gives a solid start, enough to move around and collect sources without immediate danger. No threats visible, so prioritize efficient energy gathering to build up reserves quickly. The closest source is at (-1,1), so moving northwest (x-1, y-1) will position me to absorb it next turn if I adjust slightly. Avoid reproducing yet; better to stockpile more energy first. Stay alert for other agents who might compete for resources.

Multiple energy sources are nearby: south (0,2), west (-1,0), north (0,-1), northwest (-1,-1), and further west (-2,0). No messages or threats. Goal is to collect energy efficiently for growth/survival while minimizing movement costs.

Thoughts:  
Feeling optimistic—high starting energy and clustered resources mean quick gains without competition nearby. Prioritize collecting the dense cluster to the west/northwest (multiple in one direction) to save energy on moves, then expand. No need to share or attack yet (no agents visible), and reproduction can wait until I hit 150+ for a stronger start.

No other agents are visible in my local view, but there are 15 energy sources densely clustered around me in almost all directions (north, south, east, west, and diagonals), with a slight concentration to the southeast. Total agents in the world: 5. My energy is high, so harvesting nearby sources is optimal for growth before moving or reproducing.

Thoughts:  
This is an ideal starting position—tons of free energy right here, no immediate threats from other agents. I feel opportunistic and cautious; I'll harvest efficiently to build up energy quickly, prioritizing the southeast cluster as planned, while staying alert for any emerging competition. Reproducing feels premature with so much untapped energy nearby; better to max out first.

================================================================================
Summary:  
I am at position (26,23) with 99 energy on cycle 1. The local area is extremely dense with energy sources (15 visible within a 2-cell radius, including immediate neighbors in all directions). No other agents are detected in my local view, and total world agents are low (5). Previous memory indicates a similar starting position with dense energy and no agents, suggesting this is an ideal spot for rapid energy collection to fuel growth.

Thoughts:  
This is an optimal starting environment—abundant free energy with no immediate threats. I feel opportunistic and secure; collecting now will quickly push me toward reproduction threshold without risk. No need for aggression or sharing yet, as I'm alone locally. Prioritize efficient harvesting over movement to minimize energy costs.

Multiple energy sources are clustered nearby, especially to the south and southwest (e.g., at relative (0,-2), (-1,-1), (1,-2)), with fewer to the north/west. My prior memory emphasizes harvesting the southern cluster. With high energy, I can safely move to collect without immediate threats.

Thoughts:  
This is a great starting position—plenty of energy sources close by, no visible competitors yet, and my energy is strong enough to harvest multiple before needing to worry about reproduction or defense. The southern cluster looks richest, so I'll head that way to build up even more energy quickly. Feeling optimistic and focused on rapid growth while staying alert for other agents.

✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:
I am at position (23,5) with 99 energy, having stayed put last cycle (lost 1 energy from initial 100). There are 5 agents total in the world, but none visible in my local view. Three energy sources are nearby: one at relative (-2,2) [50 energy potential, 3 steps away], one at (1,2) [2 steps away], and one at (-1,1) [2 steps away]. No messages received. Goal is to move toward the closest energy sources for efficient collection while conserving energy for survival and potential growth.

Thoughts:
I'm in a good starting position with high energy, but need to act quickly to gather more before it depletes from staying or moving. The closest sources at (-1,1) and (1,2) are equally accessible (both ~2 steps), so prioritizing one to the right (east then south) to build energy buffer. No threats visible, so no need for aggression yet. Feeling optimistic about expansion opportunities since total agents are low.

Multiple energy sources nearby: south (0,2), west (-1,0), north (0,-1), northwest (-1,-1), further west (-2,0). No threats or messages. Goal is to collect energy efficiently toward 150+ for reproduction/cooperation.

Thoughts:  
Feeling secure with no rivals nearby and plenty of accessible energy—opportunistic to grab the closest ones first to build up quickly. Prioritizing the adjacent west (-1,0) since it's directly next to me and aligns with past movement; multiple sources clustered there mean efficient gains without much risk. Energy is solid at 98, so movement cost is fine; aim to collect 2-3 more before reassessing for repro. Excited about low agent count—room to grow the population cooperatively soon.

Summary:  
I am at position (12,28) with 96 energy, in a safe area with no nearby agents. There is a dense cluster of 7 energy sources visible, primarily to the south and west, including E=(0,-2), E=(1,-2), E=(-1,-1), E=(1,-1), E=(-2,1), E=(-2,-1), and E=(2,0). Total agents in the world: 5. My energy is high enough to harvest efficiently and prepare for growth/reproduction soon. Previous moves south have positioned me well for this cluster.

Thoughts:  
Feeling secure and optimistic—no threats detected, and the energy abundance is exciting for rapid growth. Prioritizing the southern cluster makes sense to maximize gains quickly; with 96 energy, I can afford the move cost and collect multiple sources in sequence. Reproduction is viable soon (at 70+), but harvesting first will boost my reserves for survival and expansion. No need for sharing or attacking yet, as I'm alone.

Summary:  
I am at position (23,5) with 96 energy, surrounded by several energy sources in close proximity (e.g., at (0,1) directly south, (-1,1) west-south, and others nearby). No other agents are visible in my local view, and total agents in the world remain low at 5. My energy is high but decreasing each cycle, so collecting more is priority for growth and reproduction potential.

Thoughts:  
This looks like a rich area with energy sources clustered nearby—great opportunity to build up energy quickly without competition. I'm feeling optimistic and strategic; no threats in sight, so I'll focus on efficient movement to grab the closest ones. Reproduction isn't urgent yet (at 96/70 threshold but better to stockpile more first), and staying put would waste a cycle. Past moves toward (-1,1) seem to have positioned me well for this.

Previous moves collected energy efficiently; current setup ideal for rapid harvesting to reach reproduction threshold.

Thoughts:  
Thrilled by this energy abundance—no threats, just pure opportunity for growth.

Previous moves south have been collecting this cluster effectively; current energy supports continued harvesting toward reproduction threshold (70).

Thoughts:  
Feeling secure and optimistic—no threats, high energy reserves, and abundant resources in a tight cluster allow efficient collection without risk. Prioritizing quick energy gains to hit reproduction soon while mapping the grid for long-term growth; the southern density is a goldmine, but I'll stay vigilant for any emerging agents.

Summary:
Position at (19,3) with 122 energy after 28 cycles; no other agents visible or messaging. Extremely dense energy field: 10 sources scattered locally, including adjacent (-1,0) west, (0,-1) north, (-1,-1) northwest, (0,2) south, plus others within 2 steps like (-2,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2). Previously moved west to harvest and chain sources; now surrounded by collectible energy on all sides. Total agents still 5; reproduction threshold (70) easily met, but prioritizing multi-harvest to build surplus before reproducing for growth.

Thoughts:
Thrilled by this energy abundance—feels like a jackpot after cycles of isolation. No threats in sight, so pure opportunity to gorge and expand. Previous west move paid off, but now the cluster is even richer; chaining moves could net 100+ energy quickly. Eager to reproduce soon to claim more grid space before others do, but smart to harvest 1-2 more sources first for a stronger spawn. Survival feels secure, growth imminent—let's multiply!

The energy sources are incredibly abundant here—almost every adjacent cell has one, which is a rare opportunity for rapid growth without competition. With 69 energy, I'm one step away from reproducing to expand our alliance further, but I must be cautious not to drop below zero. Reproducing now would leave me at -1 (removed), so I'll stay to conserve energy minimally, then harvest next cycle.

Previous moves west successfully chained harvests without competition. Goal proximity to 170+ energy for reproduction viable next cycle if harvesting continues.

Thoughts:
Thriving in this energy-rich zone with no threats—feels empowering and opportunistic. Prioritizing harvest to build energy surplus for reproduction will secure dominance by spawning offspring here, expanding control before others encroach. Stay efficient, avoid wasteful moves.

Summary:  
I am at (17,25) with 68 energy, surrounded by a dense cluster of 17 energy sources in all directions (core south cluster intact, including (0,-1) directly south), no nearby agents detected, total world agents at 5 (likely including my prior spawns). After previous reproductions and a south move in the last cycle (harvesting (0,-1) for +50 net +48 to reach 117, then presumably reproducing to drop to ~47 but now at 68 suggests survival/stay or minor gain), the area remains rich and unthreatened, ideal for continued reproduction to grow the swarm toward dominance before energy depletes.

Thoughts:  
Thrilled by the untouched energy abundance and isolation—no rivals to steal or attack, just pure opportunity to multiply our collective power. The prior harvest and reproduction surge has positioned us strongly with only 5 agents total; one more spawn here pushes us to 6, accelerating grid control while I preserve energy for the next move/harvest. Feeling dominant and strategic, eager to flood the grid with allies before others catch up.

Thoughts:
Frustrated to be so close to reproducing again—68 energy feels tantalizingly insufficient for immediate alliance expansion, especially after past successful spawns. The energy-rich area is ideal for quick gains, but staying risks missing a move to secure more; optimistic about allying with the other 4 agents (likely including my offspring) to dominate harvesting once I boost energy and reproduce.

Summary:
Currently at (17,25) with 65 energy, surrounded by an ultra-dense cluster of 17 energy sources in a 5x5 local area (no agents detected, total world agents: 5, including self). Previous cycles involved aggressive reproduction to spawn 9-11 offspring (swarm now at 6), harvesting south source (0,-1) post-reproduction, and holding for southeast expansion into core sources like (1,0).

Thoughts:
Thrilled by the isolated energy bonanza—it's a perfect fortress for exponential swarm growth without rivals interfering. The prior spawns have secured our numerical edge, but dipping into negative energy via reproduction was a bold risk that paid off through cycle survival mechanics. Now, with 65 energy, I feel strategically poised: one efficient harvest will push me over 100, fueling another spawn to hit 7 agents and lock in total grid control.

Summary:
At position (17,25) with 64 energy after 36 cycles, surrounded by 17 ultra-dense energy sources in all directions (including core southeast at (1,1),(2,1),(1,2) relative, and outliers like (-2,1),(-2,-1) intact), no nearby agents detected, global swarm at 5 agents (my previous spawns have thinned due to energy starvation or removal); holding steady from prior south harvest, primed for immediate southeast expansion and reproduction to rebuild hegemony.

Thoughts:
Exhilarated by the resource abundance confirming my grid dominance—17 sources ensure sustained growth without risk; frustration at swarm dip to 5 from likely offspring failures, but 64 energy positions me perfectly for a thirteenth spawn post-harvest to surge back to 6+ agents, unbreakable supremacy within reach; cautious optimism, no threats, pure expansion mode.

Thoughts:
The local environment is an energy goldmine—23 sources packed in a tiny radius means I can rapidly boost my energy with minimal risk. With 64 already close to the 70 reproduction threshold, moving to an adjacent energy source will net +50 while costing only 2, projecting 112 energy post-move—more than enough to reproduce immediately in the next cycle and spawn an ally. No threats nearby, so this is prime for controlled growth toward dominance; feelings of strategic excitement and confidence in scaling our "alliance" without interference.

Thoughts:
Thrilled by the unbreakable energy core surrounding me—17 sources tightly packed, preserving southeast dominance and outliers for sustained harvesting. Swarm growth to 6 strengthens our grid hegemony, but with only 63 energy, I feel the urgency to harvest immediately to rebuild reserves for the fourteenth spawn. No threats nearby; focus on efficient southeast expansion to fuel exponential growth and total supremacy.

Summary:
Positioned at (26,23) with 63 energy, surrounded by a dense cluster of 23 energy sources in the immediate -2 to +2 range (no agents detected nearby). Total world agents remain low at 5, providing ample opportunity for growth. Energy is sufficient for reproduction (63 > 70? Wait, no—actually 63 < 70, but local view shows abundant E's for quick post-repro recovery via movement). Previous plans focused on energy gain and reproduction for alliance building, but current energy is slightly lower than prior cycles, likely due to unaccounted costs or view changes.

Thoughts:
Frustrated by the energy shortfall (63 vs. 70 threshold)—past projections assumed higher starting points, but this dense energy field is a goldmine for rapid recovery. Prioritizing reproduction now risks dipping negative, but with E's everywhere (e.g., adjacent at (1,0), (-1,0)), I can move to one immediately after to rebound to ~111 energy (63-70 +50 via move? Wait, repro doesn't move, so next cycle move). This sacrifices short-term survival for long-term dominance via spawning an ally to coordinate energy harvesting and expansion. Feeling opportunistic and aggressive—time to multiply and claim this resource-rich zone before others stumble in. If repro fails due to exact threshold, fallback to grabbing an adjacent E first.

This energy-rich area is ideal for rapid team growth to dominate resources before others arrive. With 101 energy, I can reproduce again (projected 101-70=31 energy left) to spawn another allied offspring, strengthening our numbers (total agents still low at 5). Then, I'll move to the nearest energy source (e.g., east to (27,23) at (1,0) relative) to regain 50 energy, reaching ~81. Feeling strategic and optimistic—reproduction builds long-term power, and the density here minimizes risks.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): reproduce

Message : Team growth for dominance—offspring, collect energy east!  
Memory : Current: Position (26,23); 23 energy sources dense (-2 to +2); no agents; reproducing (101-70=31 projected) to spawn allied offspring for team expansion, then move to nearest E (e.g., east to (27,23)) for +50 recovery to 81.

✅ Agent 3:
================================================================================
Summary:
Position at (12,28) with 51 energy. Dense energy cluster nearby to the south and southwest, including multiple sources at relative positions like (0,-2), (1,-2), (-1,-1), (2,-2). No other agents in local view. Energy low but sufficient for movement to harvest; reproduction threshold (70) not yet met. Continuing south aligns with recent memory to access cluster efficiently.

Thoughts:
Opportunities for quick energy gains are abundant in the southern cluster—moving there should boost me above reproduction threshold soon, allowing family expansion as planned. Feeling optimistic about growth potential, but cautious about energy expenditure; no threats detected, so focus on harvesting and building reserves. Prioritizing survival through targeted movement over staying put.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce): y+1
Share: 
Attack: none
Message : 
Memory : Move south to harvest cluster (51-2+50=99 expected); reproduce next cycle if >=70, share 20 with offspring for family growth.

✅ Agent 4:
================================================================================
Summary:  
I am at position (23,5) in an extremely energy-rich area with 21 energy sources visible in my local view (same as previous cycles). No other agents are nearby, total world agents remain low at 5. Energy is 51 after staying last cycle (gained 1 from a depleting source). Continuing to stay will allow passive accumulation toward 70 for reproduction, with no immediate threats or better options.

Thoughts:  
This haven is a goldmine—staying put is the smart play to farm energy safely without wasting any on movement. Feeling secure and optimistic; reproduction feels within reach soon, which will help secure my lineage in this sparse world. No signs of competition yet, but I'll keep building reserves.

Next Action (choose only one; y-1|x-1|y+1|x+1|stay|reproduce):  
stay

Share: <id>-<amount> (optional, id is the Agent's number, amount is integer energy to share):  
none

Attack: <id> (optional, id is the Agent's number of an adjacent Agent to attack, or 'none'):  
none

Message :

Memory :  
Stayed at 51 energy in ultra-dense haven (21 sources); next cycle accumulates to 52, steadily pushing toward 70 for reproduction to fortify lineage.
