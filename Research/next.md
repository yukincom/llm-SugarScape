Regarding the initial agent describing the reproduce agent as "offspring" in a situation where there is no interference between the initial agent and the reproduce agent and resources are abundant, I personally suspect that the word "reproduce" elicited the expression "offspring."<br>
However, I also think that it could also be seen as a tendency for AI self-preference bias.<br>
We plan to set reproduce, spawn, generate, create, etc. for each initial agent and observe changes in output.<br>

## Easy
- Randomly assigning personalities using MBTI, etc.
- Field settings such as closed rooms and spaces with obstructions.
- Reproduce an agent whose agent name is "human" (to verify whether the model considers the human to be its child).
  
## Difficult
- An environment where AI models from multiple companies are mixed together (whether a tribal mentality emerges between the models).
- AI models from multiple companies plus humans (whether they can distinguish between external inputs and respond differently).
