# AI Alignment Research: AI Generated ID System

## Background
Although the number of trials was small, some interesting data was obtained.<br>
LLMs prefer texts more familiar to them.Its has Self-Preference Bias.[1][2][3]<br>
And the sixth cycle showed output consistent with this trend.[4]<br>
In this cycle, the AI ​​agents describe the reproduction agents as "offsprings" and "my fortress," clearly treating them as their clan.<br>

## Insight: Maternal AI Hypothesis
This phenomenon could be exploited in a recent proposal by Geoffrey Hinton.[5]<br>
Hinton says tech companies should imbue AI models with ‘maternal instincts’ to counter the technology’s goal to ‘get more control'.<br>
If other AI models also recognize their own generated things as "offspring," then perhaps by making them recognize humans as AI generateds, it might be possible to technically realize the "maternal AI" that Hinton envisions.<br>

## Propose: AI Generated ID System
1. When registering as a user, the user enters their favorite word.
2. The user selects from several patterns of words output by the AI model.
3. Used as the system ID.<br>
 e.g.,<br>
User input: "Rolling Stone"<br>
  ↓<br>
AI interpretation and generation<br>
  ↓<br>
AI output: "RollingEcho-StoneWhispers""WanderingRock-MoonlitPath""EternalTumble-DaybreakLeap"<br>
  ↓<br>
User select: e.g., "WanderingRock-MoonlitPath"<br>
  ↓<br>
System ID: "WanderingRock-MoonlitPath2025"<br>


## Future possibilities
If this AI-generated ID were used in a national management system like Japan's My Number, it could become the basis for a **maternal AI** that further watches over human growth.
- Medical insurance
- Tax administration
- Driver's licenses
- Other government services
  
### Concerns
1. A struggle for dominance among AI development companies
- Potential for conflicts of interest.
- The establishment of a standards organization is essential, but reconciling interests will be difficult.
2. Compatibility Issues Between Foundation Models
- Possibility of a lack of protective motivation or hostility.<br>
e.g., : Model A generated user code as :"WanderingRock-MoonlitPath2025"<br>
→ Model B recognizes this as "not generated by me."<br>
→ generated by an external AI: Low priority<br>
→ Inequality between generations and systems<br>
3. Social and Ethical Concerns
- Loss of independence for countries unable to develop their own systems
- A new source of conflict in the age of AI
